"""FLIP's Flower base strategy — FedAvg plus Central Hub telemetry.

``FlipFedAvg`` is the durable home for everything a FLIP Flower server app
reports to the hub: the RUNNING status, per-client metric and
exception forwarding (``flip.flower.metrics``), and the typed round events
(``flip.flower.progress``). App templates subclass it and keep only their
app-specific behaviour; the telemetry evolves here, in flip-utils, without
touching uploaded apps.

Round events attach to the phase the strategy actually runs: training rounds
emit around configure_train/aggregate_train; an evaluation-only strategy
(``fraction_train=0.0``) emits around the evaluate phase instead, so every job
type yields a coherent round timeline without double-emission.

Like ``flip.flower.privacy``, importing this module requires the ``flwr`` package
(present in the Flower fl-server images) — it subclasses the real ``FedAvg``.
Keep logic in the helpers; this class is wiring.
