"""Client-side differential privacy for FLIP's Flower apps.

FLIP's NVFLARE apps privatise every training result before it leaves the client, via the
``PercentilePrivacy`` result filter wired into ``config_fed_client.json``. This module is the
Flower counterpart: a ``Mod`` that clips the local update to a fixed L2 norm and adds calibrated
Gaussian noise **on the SuperNode**, so the fl-server only ever receives a privatised update.
Unlike the NVFLARE filter — percentile sparsification with no noise — this is a real
(epsilon, delta) mechanism.

The maths is Flower's own (``compute_clip_model_update`` and ``add_gaussian_noise_inplace`` from
``flwr.supercore.differential_privacy``), and the noise scale is the formula used by
``flwr.clientapp.mod.LocalDpMod``. Two things are added on top of instantiating ``LocalDpMod``
directly:

* **A config toggle.** Mods are constructed at import time, before ``run_config`` exists, so a bare
  ``LocalDpMod(...)`` bakes its parameters into the module source. Reading them from
  ``context.run_config`` on each call gives the same ergonomics as the NVFLARE filter's ``off``
  flag: DP-on and DP-off runs use an identical app, with no component added or removed.
* **Integer buffers are passed through untouched.** Flower's ``clip_inputs_inplace`` scales each
  array in place by a float, which raises ``UFuncTypeError`` on an integer array the moment
  clipping actually engages. Real models hit this: MONAI's ``DenseNet121`` state dict carries 121
  int64 ``num_batches_tracked`` BatchNorm counters, and the spleen ``UNet`` (``norm="batch"``)
  carries its own. Those counters are step counts rather than learned parameters, so only the
  floating-point arrays are clipped and noised.

Usage — training only, mirroring the scope of the NVFLARE filter::

    from flip.flower.privacy import flip_local_dp_mod

    app = ClientApp()

    @app.train(mods=[flip_local_dp_mod])
    def train(msg: Message, context: Context) -> Message:
        ...

Like ``flip.flower.strategy``, importing this module requires the ``flwr`` package (present in the
Flower FL images).

    The defaults are deliberately **utility-first**: they keep the shipped tutorials trainable

    are not a defensible privacy budget. A real budget calibrates ``sensitivity`` to the local

    composition across rounds, neither of which this mechanism does — each round spends the budget
