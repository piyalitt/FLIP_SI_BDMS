FLIP - Federated Learning and Interoperability Platform

This package provides the core functionality for federated learning in the FLIP platform.

Main exports:
    - `FLIP`: Factory function that returns the appropriate FLIP implementation based on job type
    - `FLIPBase`: Abstract base class for FLIP implementations
    - `ResultsUploadError`: Raised when uploading training results to S3 fails

Example usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from flip import FLIP

    flip = FLIP()  # Uses default "standard" job type

    df = flip.get_dataframe(project_id, query)
