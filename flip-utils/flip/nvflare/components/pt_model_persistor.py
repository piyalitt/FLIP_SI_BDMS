class InitialCheckpointPTModelPersistor(PTFileModelPersistor):
    """Persistor that seeds the initial global model from a large backbone checkpoint
    staged **server-side**, so the checkpoint never has to be bundled into the job app
    (bundling a ~759 MiB file collapses NVFLARE's app-deploy to remote clients).

    The backbone filename is declared in the job's ``config.json`` under ``SERVER_CHECKPOINT``.
    At load time it is resolved in this order:

      1. ``<app>/custom/<checkpoint>`` — a checkpoint bundled in the app. Used by the local
         simulator (which copies the file into ``custom/``) and any legacy bundling.
      2. ``<SERVER_CHECKPOINT_ROOT>/<model_id>/<checkpoint>`` — the de-bundled checkpoint the
         FL API staged on the hub-local shared volume (production). Read straight from disk;
         the checkpoint is intentionally NOT shipped in the app bundle, so it never reaches
         the clients. Mirrors the Flower backend's ``/app/src`` shared mount and the eval
         ``EvaluationModelLocator``.

    The resolved checkpoint is loaded (``strict=False``) into the ``get_model()`` architecture
    so the round-0 global model that ScatterAndGather broadcasts carries the backbone **plus**
    freshly-initialised heads — a full state dict the clients can load. Clients therefore build
    only a bare architecture and receive all weights at round 0; they need no checkpoint file.

    When ``config.json`` declares no ``SERVER_CHECKPOINT`` (every other standard training job),
    this behaves exactly like the stock ``PTFileModelPersistor`` (initial weights from the model
    object), so it is a safe drop-in for the shared standard base app.
