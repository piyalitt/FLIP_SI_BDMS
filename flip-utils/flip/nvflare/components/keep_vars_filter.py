    The include-only inverse of NVFLARE's ``ExcludeVars`` (which is exclude-only). Used as a
    client-side ``task_result_filter`` to shrink a per-round update to just the trainable
    parameters: a frozen-backbone fine-tune sends only its head (~KB) instead of the full model
    (~759 MiB), which fixes the large-payload client→server ``SubmitUpdate`` timeout (FLIP#684).

    Keeping only the head is correct for a frozen backbone: the backbone is identical on every
    client after round 0, so it need not be re-aggregated; the server retains it from the round-0
    global model (delivered by ``InitialCheckpointPTModelPersistor``) and the aggregator merges the
    head diff into it. Stock ``WEIGHT_DIFF`` aggregation is natively partial-safe — the shareable
    generator applies only the keys present in the averaged diff, so every other key keeps its
    global value and a head-only update lands correctly.
