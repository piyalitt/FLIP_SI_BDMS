    percentile/gamma filtering maths (Shokri and Shmatikov, "Privacy-preserving deep learning",
    CCS '15) tracks upstream instead of drifting from a vendored copy. The sole FLIP addition is
    ``off``: it lets the filter stay wired into ``config_fed_client.json``'s result-filter chain
    while being switched on/off from config (e.g. running DP-on vs DP-off experiments) without
    adding or removing the component.
