"""A small XNAT REST client, scoped to what data enrichment needs.

Deliberately built on ``requests`` (already a core dependency) rather than a full XNAT client
library, so this module stays import-light inside the FL images that vendor ``flip``. The endpoint
shapes mirror those the Trust imaging-api already uses in
``imaging_api/services/upload.py`` and ``imaging_api/services/projects.py``.
