"""Manifest-driven upload of enrichment files (typically segmentation labels) into XNAT.

The unit of work is a *manifest*: rows of ``accession_id, file_path`` naming a local file to place
alongside the image FLIP already pulled for that accession. This is deliberately project-agnostic —
how a manifest is built is specific to a dataset, but uploading one is not.

**The naming contract.** FL apps pair an image with its label by filename, e.g. the spleen apps do
``str(image).replace("/input_", "/label_")``. So by default the target filename is derived from the
image already sitting in the scan's resource, swapping ``input_`` for ``label_``. That keeps the
uploaded name in lock-step with whatever DICOM-to-NIfTI conversion produced, instead of guessing.
