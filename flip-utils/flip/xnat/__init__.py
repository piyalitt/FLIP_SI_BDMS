XNAT helpers for the FLIP *data enrichment* stage.

Data enrichment is the platform stage where a model developer adds whatever an app needs on top of
the imaging data FLIP pulled into each Trust's XNAT — most commonly segmentation labels for a
supervised app. This subpackage uploads those files into the right XNAT scan resource so that
:meth:`flip.FLIPBase.get_by_accession_number` brings them down to the FL client alongside the image.

**Where this runs.** On the model developer's workstation inside the Trust network (or as an XNAT
Container Service job), authenticated as their own XNAT account. It is deliberately *not* part of
the FL training path: FL client containers hold no XNAT credentials and reach imaging data only
through the imaging-api proxy.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from flip.xnat import XnatClient, read_manifest, upload_enrichment_files

    client = XnatClient.from_env()
    project = client.resolve_project_by_flip_project_id("<flip-project-uuid>")
    summary = upload_enrichment_files(
        client,
        project,
        read_manifest("manifest.csv"),
    )
    print(summary.render())
