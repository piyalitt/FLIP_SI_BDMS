# flip-utils — the `flip` Python package

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/flip-utils)](https://pypi.org/project/flip-utils/)
[![Python 3.12+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/londonaicentreflip/badge/?version=latest)](https://londonaicentreflip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-green.svg)](../LICENSE.md)

This directory is a sub-tree of the [FLIP](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP) mono-repo. It hosts the
pip-installable `flip` Python package (published as `flip-utils` on PyPI) that ships inside every FL server / client
image and is imported as `from flip import ...` by user-uploaded training code. Sibling FL trees in the same mono-repo:

- **[`flip-utils/flip/`](./flip/)** — pip-installable Python package with platform logic, NVFLARE components, Flower helpers and utilities (this directory)
- **[`../fl-apps/`](../fl-apps/)** — FL job-type implementations / app templates per backend (`nvflare/{standard,evaluation,diffusion_model,fed_opt}`, `flower/{standard,evaluation}`)
- **[`../fl-tutorials/`](../fl-tutorials/)** — runnable end-to-end tutorial examples per backend (`nvflare/`, `flower/`)
- **[`../fl-services/`](../fl-services/)** — Docker images and network provisioning for FL networks per backend (`nvflare/`, `flower/`); each backend's `Makefile` owns build / provision / up / down / submit

Paths like `tutorials/` referenced in older sections of this README refer to the now-sibling top-level
[`../fl-tutorials/`](../fl-tutorials/) tree, and Make targets called out below run from the `flip-utils/` directory
unless otherwise noted.

## flip Python Package

The [`flip`](./flip/) package is the core pip-installable library for the FLIP federated learning platform. It provides
all platform logic core to training and evaluating FL applications.

### Installation

```bash
uv sync
# or
pip install .
```

To build a distributable package:

```bash
uv build
```

```

The `FLIP()` factory selects `FLIPStandardDev` (local CSV/filesystem) or `FLIPStandardProd` (FLIP platform APIs) based
on the `LOCAL_DEV` environment variable.

The `flip.flower` sub-package is intended **only for fl-server code**. Its helpers forward per-client metrics and
crashed-reply exceptions — extracted from Flower reply Messages in `Strategy.aggregate_train` /
`aggregate_evaluate` — to the Central Hub. fl-client containers must never import it and must never hold the
`INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` credential. For the NVFLARE equivalent, see `flip.nvflare.metrics`.

`FlipFedAvg` also owns opt-in **best-global-model selection**: constructed with `best_model_metric` (and
`best_model_metric_minimize` for loss-like metrics), it scores each round's freshly aggregated model on the
aggregated evaluation metrics (`flip.flower.selection.BestModelSelector`) and retains the best-scoring arrays.
The `fl-apps/flower/standard` template maps the `best-model-metric` / `best-model-metric-minimize` run-config
keys onto it and saves `best_FL_global_model.pt` alongside `FL_global_model.pt` when a selection actually
happened — unset, evaluation stays final-round-only and no best artefact is produced. NVFLARE reaches the same
contract with the stock `IntimeModelSelector` (see `FlipFedAvgRecipe`).

**The two backends aggregate the selection metric differently, deliberately.** On Flower the value the
selector sees is whatever stock `FedAvg` produced — a **weighted average keyed on `num-examples`**, so a
trust with more test samples pulls the score further. NVFLARE's `IntimeModelSelector` defaults to
`weigh_by_local_iter=False` with no `aggregation_weights`, i.e. a plain **unweighted mean** across clients.
Neither lets a single site dictate selection, but the same metric can pick a different round on each backend
when trust cohort sizes are uneven; expect that rather than treating it as a bug.

### User Application Requirements

The job components dynamically import user-provided files from the job's `custom/`
directory. On the platform that directory is assembled by the FL API, which merges the
uploaded app files onto the matching `fl-apps/nvflare/<JOB_TYPE>/app` template; in local
SimEnv runs the tutorial's `job.py` stages its `app_files/` into the job's `custom/`
directly.

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `trainer.py` | Training logic — a plain `nvflare.client` script (`flare.init`/`receive`/`send`) |
| `validator.py` | Extra validation module where the job type requires one (`diffusion_model`) |
| `models.py` | Model definitions — must export `get_model()` function |
| `config.json` | Hyperparameters — must include `LOCAL_ROUNDS` and `LEARNING_RATE`; optional `BEST_MODEL_METRIC` / `BEST_MODEL_METRIC_MINIMIZE` enable best-model selection (see below) |
| `transforms.py` | Data transforms (optional) |

### Best-Model Selection (optional)

By default only the final aggregated model is saved. Setting `BEST_MODEL_METRIC` (and, for
loss-like metrics, `BEST_MODEL_METRIC_MINIMIZE: true`) wires NVFLARE's stock
`IntimeModelSelector` into the job so the best global model is saved too:

- Each round, clients evaluate the **received global model** on their local validation split
  *before* training and report the metrics via `FLModel(metrics={...})` — so the selection metric
  measures exactly the checkpoint being considered.
- The selector averages the chosen metric across clients and, on improvement, has the persistor
  save `best_FL_global_model.pt` next to `FL_global_model.pt` — same file format as the final
  model. Round 0 is skipped (no aggregated model exists yet), so selection needs
  `GLOBAL_ROUNDS >= 2` — a single-round job can never save a best model.
- The **final model itself is never a selection candidate**: metrics are evaluated on received
  global models before training, and the last round's aggregate is never re-broadcast, so there
  is no post-last-round evaluation. "Best" therefore means best among the intermediate global
  models — the final model may in fact outperform the saved best, in which case the two files
  differ even though the final is the better checkpoint.
- The results zip contains the best model only when selection ran and saved one; no best file is
  fabricated from the final model otherwise.

The metric label must be one the trainer reports (e.g. the client-API x-ray tutorial reports
`VAL_LOSS`, per-lesion `VAL-<METRIC>-<lesion>` and macro `VAL-<METRIC>` labels). Wired for both
supported paths: the `standard` recipe (`FlipFedAvgRecipe(best_model_metric=...)`) and
platform-submitted jobs, where fl-api-base's job-assembly step (`prepare_config.validate_config` /
`configure_server`) reads `BEST_MODEL_METRIC` / `BEST_MODEL_METRIC_MINIMIZE` straight from the
uploaded `config.json` and injects the same selector. On the platform path, a `config.json` that
sets `BEST_MODEL_METRIC` without an explicit `GLOBAL_ROUNDS >= 2` is rejected at upload (the
platform defaults to a single round, where selection could never fire).

### Job Types

Pass the job type to the `FLIP()` factory (`FLIP(job_type=...)`). The `JobType` enum
(`flip.constants.job_types`) defines the values recognised by `FLIP()`:

| Type | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `standard` | Federated training with FedAvg aggregation (default) |
| `evaluation` | Distributed model evaluation without training |
| `diffusion_model` | Two-stage training (VAE encoder + diffusion) |
| `fed_opt` | Custom federated optimization |

The NVFLARE templates under `fl-apps/nvflare/` (`standard`, `evaluation`, `diffusion_model`,
`fed_opt`) are all Client-API apps with recipe-generated configs. The corresponding configs live
in `fl-apps/nvflare/<template>/app/config/`.

### Development Mode

DEV mode lets you run an FL application locally on the NVFLARE simulator before
deploying. The runnable tutorials live in [`../fl-tutorials/`](../fl-tutorials/); each
carries a `.env.app` (`JOB_TYPE`, `DEV_IMAGES_DIR`, `DEV_DATAFRAME`) and a `job.py` that
drives a FLIP recipe on the NVFLARE simulator (SimEnv) from the flip-utils venv.

1. Get the tutorial's dataset. The xray tutorial pulls a reference dataset from Hugging
   Face (`make -C fl-tutorials download-xray-data`); the spleen tutorials generate their
   own data via the segmentation tutorial's `utils/` scripts (see each tutorial's README).

2. Adapt the tutorial's `app_files/` as needed; on the platform they are merged onto the
   matching `fl-apps/nvflare/<JOB_TYPE>/app` template at submit time.

3. Run a tutorial on the simulator (requires a GPU):

   ```bash
   make -C fl-tutorials download-xray-data                       # xray dataset (one-off)
   make -C fl-tutorials list-tutorials
   make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=xray_classification
   make -C fl-tutorials run-all-tutorials   # every tutorial (heavy; stops on first failure)
   ```

### Unit Tests

```bash
make unit-test
# or
uv run pytest -s -vv
```

## Tutorials

The [`../fl-tutorials/`](../fl-tutorials/) directory contains ready-to-use example applications that can be uploaded to the FLIP platform UI. Each tutorial is designed to work with a specific app template from `../fl-apps/<backend>/`, and runs on the local FL simulator via `make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=<name>` (defaults to `FL_BACKEND=nvflare`; pass `FL_BACKEND=flower` for Flower).

### App / Tutorial Compatibility

Paths below are relative to `../fl-tutorials/nvflare/` (the NVFLARE tutorials tree):

| App | Tutorial |
|-----|----------|
| `standard` | `image_classification/xray_classification` |
| `standard` | `image_segmentation/3d_spleen_segmentation` |
| `evaluation` | `image_evaluation/3d_spleen_segmentation_evaluation` |
| `diffusion_model` | `image_synthesis/latent_diffusion_model` |

The plain job-type names (`standard`, `evaluation`, `diffusion_model`, `fed_opt`) are the
Client-API templates — the legacy Executor syntax (`FLIP_TRAINER`-style classes) is retired and
such apps can no longer run.

---

## FL Services API

The [`../fl-services/nvflare/`](../fl-services/nvflare/README.md) directory contains Docker-based NVFLARE services. See the [FL services README](../fl-services/nvflare/README.md) and the [FL API README](../fl-services/nvflare/fl-api-base/README.md) for full details on provisioning and the API endpoints.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python package manager)
- AWS CLI configured (for provisioning kit uploads to S3)

### Provisioning the 2 Networks

Generate the certificates, keys, and configuration for the 2 FL networks:

```bash
make -C fl-services/nvflare provision-2-nets
```

This uses the network-specific provisioning project files (`fl-services/nvflare/provision/net-1_project_dev.yml` and `net-2_project_dev.yml`) and provisions the network files in `fl-services/nvflare/provision/workspace-dev/net-1` and `fl-services/nvflare/provision/workspace-dev/net-2` (gitignored) using the [fl-services/nvflare/provision/scripts/provision-network.sh](../fl-services/nvflare/provision/scripts/provision-network.sh) script.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Provisioned files contain cryptographic signatures. Any modification will cause errors. Always re-run provisioning if changes are needed.

### Provisioning Networks for Staging/Production

Note the provisioning project file `net-1_project_stag.yml` changes the name of the FL server to the full domain name i.e. `stag.flip.aicentre.co.uk` instead of `fl-server-net-1`, since the FL
clients won't be on the same Docker network as the FL server (as they are in development) and won't be able to resolve internal Docker hostnames.

Run:

```bash
make -C fl-services/nvflare provision-stag
```

### Creating a New Network

Create a provisioning project file under `fl-services/nvflare/provision/` (e.g. `net-3_project_dev.yml`) based on the template (`net-1_project_dev.yml`) (you'll likely need to change `fed_learn_port`) and run:

```bash
make -C fl-services/nvflare provision NET_NUMBER=3
```

### Running a Network

From ``fl-services/nvflare/`` (the per-backend Makefile that owns these targets — the
``flip-utils/`` directory itself only ships ``unit-test``):

```bash
make build                # Build the :dev FL images (flare-fl-{base,server,client,api})
make up NET_NUMBER=1      # Start the network (server, 2 clients, API)
make down NET_NUMBER=1    # Stop the network — must match the NET_NUMBER used for `up`
                          # (compose embeds it in container names + mount paths)
```

### Running the tutorials

Each NVFLARE tutorial runs on the local simulator via the [`fl-tutorials/`](../fl-tutorials/)
Makefile. Download the tutorial's dataset first (see its README), then:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=xray_classification
make -C fl-tutorials run-all-tutorials
```

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows use OIDC to authenticate to AWS (no long-lived keys).

The base FL application templates (this `fl-apps/` tree) are **no longer published to S3**. They are
baked into the flip-api image at build time and read from a local directory (`FL_APP_BASE_DIR`,
default `/app/fl-apps`); flip-api validates job types and bundles applications straight from that
tree (FLIP#724). Two CI checks still guard the templates on every PR:

- `fl-apps-check-required-files.yml` — regenerates each backend's `required_files.json` from the
  per-template arrays and fails if the committed manifest is stale.
- `fl-apps-check-tutorial-sync.yml` — keeps the Flower tutorials in sync with the `fl-apps/flower/`
  templates.

To exercise a PR's templates on a running FLIP stack **before merge**, rebuild the flip-api image
from the PR branch (the templates ride along in the image) — for local dev the `../fl-apps` bind-mount
means edits take effect immediately without a rebuild. A new job type needs no S3 sync: adding it to
`fl-apps/<backend>/` and its `required_files.json` is enough, because flip-api reads both locally.
