"""Single kit-file writer for trust/.env.<...> files (stdlib only).

One in-place-upsert implementation behind every operator-side kit write — the
dev distributor, the prod distributor, and the hub-shared sync. Merges a kit
dict (as emitted by ``flip_api.scripts.register_trust``) into a kit file while
preserving the operator's host-local edits:

- Credentials (``TRUST_API_KEY`` / ``TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY``) are written
  only when present in the kit (a new registration). The idempotent skip path
  omits them, so an existing kit's credentials are never clobbered (the hub
  stores only hashes and cannot re-emit plaintext).
- Metadata (``EXPECTED_TRUST_ID`` / ``FL_KIT_SLOT`` / ``FL_KIT_SLOT_NUMBER``)
  is present on both paths and upserted unconditionally.
- The hub-shared block is upserted under a sentinel header; the header is added
  once on first write.

Replaces the bash upsert in scripts/distribute-trust-kits.sh and
deploy/providers/AWS/scripts/register-trusts.sh::write_kit_file(), and the
in-place upsert in scripts/sync_trust_kit.py.
