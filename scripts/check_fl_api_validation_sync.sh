# Verify that the shared URL/path guards in the two fl-api services have not drifted.
#
# `safe_join` and `validate_bundle_url` are byte-identical copies in the NVFLARE and Flower
# fl-api services. They are the only SSRF and path-traversal guards in front of the server-side
# bundle fetch, so a fix applied to one copy and not the other silently leaves the second service
# vulnerable -- which is exactly what happened with the numeric-IP bypass in FLIP#893.
#
# They are copies rather than a shared module on purpose: the two services live in separate Docker
# build contexts, separate uv projects and separate published images, so extracting a shared
# distributable costs far more than it protects. This check is the cheaper guarantee.
#
# The whole files are NOT compared -- they legitimately differ (copyright header, and the Flower
# copy carries a flower-only validate_tutorial_folder_name plus its _SAFE_NAME constant). Only the
# shared function bodies are compared.
#
# Paths are relative to the repo root (this script lives in scripts/, so cd up one).

# The guards that must be shared today. This is a floor, not the comparison set: the set actually
# compared is computed below as every top-level function present in BOTH copies, so the next shared
# guard is covered the moment it is copied across rather than when someone remembers to edit this
# list -- which is the FLIP#893 failure mode one function later. Naming them here still catches the
# opposite direction: a rename or deletion that quietly empties the computed set.
