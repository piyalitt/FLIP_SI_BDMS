# Verify that tutorial files kept as byte-identical copies of another file have not
# drifted. Two families are checked:
#
#   1. Flower tutorial files copied from the fl-apps/flower/ templates.
#   2. Ark+ NVFLARE tutorial files shared between the two evaluation apps.
#
# These files cannot be symlinks: `flwr build` excludes symlinks from the FAB,
# so each tutorial keeps a real copy of the shared ServerApp and strategy, and an
# app directory is copied whole into a job. This check fails if a copy drifts from
# its reference -- resync by copying the reference over the copy.
#
# The pyproject.toml files are intentionally NOT paired: the template
# pyprojects carry platform-only [tool.uv] tables (flip-utils pinned to the
# /opt/flip-utils source baked into the FL images, torch pinned to the cu128
# index -- FLIP#767) that must not reach the tutorials, whose pyprojects drive
# workstation venvs where /opt/flip-utils does not exist. Accepted trade-off:
# dependency-list drift between a tutorial pyproject and its template is no
# longer CI-guarded -- keep their [project] dependencies aligned by hand.
#
# Paths are relative to the repo root (this script lives in scripts/, so cd up one).
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." || exit 1

  # The two Ark+ evaluation apps differ only in how many checkpoints they score; their data
  # loading and their flattened model definitions are meant to be the same file -- and they have
  # already drifted once (the Client-API port landed in the baseline copy days before the
  # multimodel copy caught up). Pinning them here is what stops a preprocessing fix landing in
  # one and not the other -- exactly how the sideways-radiograph defect spread (FLIP#871).
  # The reference side is the baseline app; resync by copying it over the multimodel copy.
  # NOTE for future pairs: adding a pair whose files live outside the trees filtered by
  # fl-apps-check-tutorial-sync.yml means extending that workflow's path filters too, or drift
  # commits on the new path will never trigger the check.
