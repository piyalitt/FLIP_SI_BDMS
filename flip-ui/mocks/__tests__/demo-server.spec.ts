/**
 * Route-coverage smoke test for the public Ark+ demo Mirage server.
 *
 * demo-server.ts registers NO passthrough — every request the demo pages
 * make must be answered by a route defined here, or it stays unhandled
 * inside Mirage. Register/page drift (a new UI page calling an endpoint the
 * recorded register never served) would otherwise surface only as a blank
 * panel discovered by a public visitor. This walks every route the project
 * and model pages actually hit, for both recorded projects and all three
 * recorded models, and asserts each one resolves — catching that class of
 * drift at build time instead.
