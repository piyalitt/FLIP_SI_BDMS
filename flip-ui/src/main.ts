/**
 * Install the mock API layer (if this build has one) and mount the app.
 *
 * The demo server is loaded through a DYNAMIC import inside the folded branch,
 * and that is a security control rather than a load-time optimisation. A static
 * `import { makeDemoServer } from "../mocks/demo-server"` is NOT dropped from a
 * production build even once this branch folds: demo-server.ts builds its
 * lookup tables at module scope with computed keys, which rolldown must treat
 * as side-effecting, so it keeps the module — and with it all 24 recorded
 * fixtures: production Cognito subs, the internal OMOP cohort SQL, the full
 * trust roster, every one of them readable by an anonymous `curl` of the public
 * entry chunk, whether or not the demo was ever deployed (FLIP#794 review).
 * Behind a dynamic import the reference disappears with the branch, so no
 * fixture chunk is emitted at all.
 *
 * Mounting waits for that install: Mirage patches XHR globally when it is
 * constructed, and the app issues its first requests during mount. Mounting
 * first would let those escape to the network before the mock exists. In a
 * non-demo build the whole branch folds away, leaving no `await` before the
 * mount, so production boot stays synchronous.
 *
 * Keep `assert-no-demo-artefacts` (npm postbuild:deploy) as the backstop for
 * all of the above — it inspects the built artefact, not the source.
