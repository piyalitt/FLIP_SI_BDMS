// Pure derivation of the Connection Status page's health model (issue #901).
// A trust's state is derived from its per-service health snapshot: trust-api
// down → Offline (nothing can be collected); any other service down or
// degraded → Degraded; else Online. The trust-api row itself derives from
// heartbeat age — the snapshot rides on the heartbeat, so a fresh heartbeat is
// the ground truth that trust-api is up. With no snapshot at all (pre-collector
// trust-api builds) every non-core service is "unknown", which never degrades —
// reproducing the page's original heartbeat-only behavior exactly.

// Thresholds for the trust-api row's own status — the service vocabulary, not the
// trust state: newer than HEARTBEAT_FRESH_S is "healthy"; older than
// HEARTBEAT_DEGRADED_S (or absent) is "down", which stateFromServices turns into
// Offline; in between is "degraded". The trust-side poll interval defaults to 5s,
// so 30s/300s gives ~6×/60× the poll cadence.

// freezes only when the trust stops sending snapshots — the collector dropped its
// snapshot (failed, hung or dead), or heartbeats stopped — about 18 missed
// heartbeats of tolerance. A trust that never reported doesn't reach this path
// (the !t.services guard catches it first). Caveat: the poller runs tasks between
// heartbeats, so a long cohort query can delay them past this window on an
// otherwise healthy trust — see FLIP#920.
