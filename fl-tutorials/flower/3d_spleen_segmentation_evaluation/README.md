# Federated Evaluation with MONAI and Flower

This example uses a MONAI UNet for 3D spleen segmentation in an evaluation-only mode. It loads a pre-trained model checkpoint and performs federated evaluation across multiple client nodes.

## Key Features

- **Evaluation-only**: No training, only evaluation of a pre-trained model
- **Customisable metrics**: the metrics are whatever `client_app`/`task.py` compute and return (this tutorial reports Dice and IoU); the server aggregates them natively
- **FLIP integration**: Uploads results to S3 and updates job status
- **WORKING_DIR environment variable**: Configurable output directory (default: `/app/runs`)

## Set up the project

│   ├── client_app.py   # Defines your ClientApp (evaluation-only)
│   ├── config.json     # Configuration for evaluation job
│   ├── data_loading.py # MONAI transforms + datalist (test data only)
│   ├── models.py       # Defines model creation
│   ├── server_app.py   # Defines your ServerApp with checkpoint loading
│   ├── strategy.py     # EvaluationStrategy: native FedAvg aggregation + FLIP forwarding
│   ├── task.py         # Defines evaluation functions
│   └── transforms.py   # MONAI transforms for preprocessing
├── pyproject.toml      # Project metadata like dependencies and configs
└── README.md
```

### Install dependencies and project

Install the dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` as well as the `monai` package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Running this tutorial

> **Run this tutorial with the Docker Compose stack, not `flwr run` / the
> Simulation Engine.** The compose stack is the supported path; the
> simulation path is documented below only so you understand why we avoid it.

### Recommended: Docker Compose

From the repository root:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials/flower/3d_spleen_segmentation_evaluation download-checkpoints  # fetch model.pt into the app
make -C fl-services/flower build   # build the fl-base / superlink / supernode images
make -C fl-services/flower up      # start fl-api, superlink, supernode-1, supernode-2
```

`download-checkpoints` places `model.pt` in the `app/` folder, where the
evaluation ServerApp reads it (via the `flip-job-dir` run-config value).

Submit the evaluation run against the `fl-api` control plane:

```bash
make -C fl-services/flower submit APP=3d_spleen_segmentation_evaluation
```

The default stack publishes no host ports; `make submit` execs into the fl-api
container and POSTs to its loopback API. To POST from the host or open the
Swagger UI, publish the fl-api port by editing the compose file and re-running
`make up`.

The FLIP API will:

1. Load the model checkpoint named by the `checkpoint` run-config value
2. Run evaluation across all connected SuperNodes
3. Aggregate metrics using the `EvaluationStrategy`
4. Save results to `WORKING_DIR/{model_id}/evaluation_outputs/`
5. Upload results to S3 (unless `LOCAL_DEV="true"`)
6. Update job status via FLIP API

The dev compose stack (`deploy/compose.development.yml` +
`deploy/compose.development.flower.yml`) wires everything correctly:

- `DEV_DATAFRAME`, `DEV_IMAGES_DIR`, `WORKING_DIR`
  are resolved from `.env.development` via `${VAR}` substitutions in each
  service's `volumes:` block and bind-mounted into the containers.
- Inside the containers the mounts land at stable locations
  (`/images`, `/dataframe_file`, `/app/runs`), and
  the `environment:` blocks point the app at those paths, so paths in the
  app resolve consistently regardless of your host layout.
- Uploaded app bundles (sources + model checkpoint) live under
  `/app/src/<model_id>`; the FL API and the SuperLink share the `/app/src`
  volume, and the evaluation ServerApp reads the checkpoint from the path in the
  `flip-job-dir` run-config value the FL API injects at submission time.

### Not recommended: Flower Simulation Engine (`flwr run`)

We deliberately do **not** document a `flwr run` invocation for this tutorial.
Running it via the Simulation Engine is technically possible but brittle, for
reasons specific to this project:

1. **Long-lived `flower-superlink` caches its environment.** `flwr run`
   submits jobs to an already-running `flower-superlink` daemon. Ray worker
   subprocesses inherit the superlink's env, *not* the env you exported on
   the `flwr run` command line — so changing `DEV_DATAFRAME=…` between runs
   has no effect until you `pkill -f flower-superlink`.
2. **ClientApp CWD is not your project directory.** `flwr run` installs a
   snapshot of the app under `~/.flwr/apps/<publisher>.<name>.<version>.<hash>/`
   and runs ClientApp subprocesses from there, so relative paths like
   `../../data/...` resolve to `~/.flwr/data/...` and fail.
3. **FLIP's `DevSettings` singleton is pinned at import time.**
   `flip/constants/pt_constants.py` reads `FlipConstants.LOCAL_DEV` at
   class-body time, which forces pydantic-settings to materialise the
   singleton before any run starts. Once pinned, later `os.environ[...]`
   writes don't propagate, so mid-run path overrides are a dead end.

Under Docker Compose none of these bite: each container starts fresh, env
vars are applied from `env_file`/`environment:` at container start, and CWDs
are fixed by `working_dir:`. Use the compose stack above.

## Data Location

By default, the app reads from:

- `data/sample_get_dataframe_response.csv`
- `data/accession-resources`

## Architecture

### Strategy Pattern

`EvaluationStrategy` in [strategy.py](app/strategy.py) is a thin subclass of Flower's
`FedAvg`. `FedAvg` already distributes the model and aggregates every metric the clients
return — a weighted average by `num-examples` — so the subclass adds only:

1. **FLIP forwarding**: `handle_client_metrics` / `handle_client_exception` push each
   client's metrics and any exceptions to the Central Hub. These need the full reply
   message, so they live in the `aggregate_evaluate` override.
2. **Per-client breakdown**: captures `{client_name: {metric_name: value}}` for the
   `evaluation_results.json` artifact uploaded to S3.

The metrics themselves are simply whatever `client_app.py` puts in its `MetricRecord` —
there is no metric declaration or validation.

## Notes

- **Evaluation only** (no training or parameter updates)
- **Metrics**: `MetricRecord` only accepts numeric values; the server aggregates whatever metric keys the client returns
- **FLIP integration**: Automatically uploads results and updates job status
- **Environment-agnostic**: Uses `WORKING_DIR` instead of hardcoded paths

## Configuration

### Metrics

Metrics are not declared in config. The client computes them in [`task.py`](app/task.py)
and returns them in its `MetricRecord`; the server's `FedAvg` strategy averages whatever
keys arrive (weighted by `num-examples`). To change which metrics are reported, edit the
`_METRICS` registry in `task.py`:

```python
_METRICS = {
    "mean_dice": lambda: DiceMetric(include_background=False, reduction="mean_batch"),
    "mean_iou": lambda: MeanIoU(include_background=False, reduction="mean_batch"),
}
```

Each metric name becomes a key in the aggregated results and a `LABEL` on the FLIP
Central Hub (e.g. `MEAN_DICE`, `MEAN_IOU`). No server or `pyproject.toml` change is needed.

### Environment Variables

- `flip-job-dir`: run-config value (in `config.toml`, not an env var) injected by the FL API at submission time; points at the app directory (`/app/src/<model_id>/app` on the shared volume) where the evaluation ServerApp reads the pre-trained model `.pt` file
- `WORKING_DIR`: Output directory for evaluation results (default: `/app/runs`)
- `LOCAL_DEV`: Set to `"true"` to skip S3 uploads during local development
- `DEV_DATAFRAME`: Path to CSV file with test data metadata
- `DEV_IMAGES_DIR`: Path to directory containing NIfTI images

### Checkpoint Configuration

The checkpoint to evaluate is set with a single `checkpoint` key under
`[tool.flwr.app.config]` — a dummy placeholder in `pyproject.toml`, overridden
per run in `app/config.toml`:

```toml
[tool.flwr.app.config]
checkpoint = "model.pt"
```

The ServerApp loads that file from `flip-job-dir` and distributes its weights to the clients.
