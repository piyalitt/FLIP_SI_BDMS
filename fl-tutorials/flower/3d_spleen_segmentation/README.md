# Federated Learning with MONAI and Flower (Quickstart Example)

This example of Flower uses a small MONAI UNet based on FLIP's implementation and a training-only `ClientApp`. It reads NIfTI data from the local `./data` folder and does not write any outputs.

## Set up the project

### Folder structure

```shell
3d_spleen_segmentation
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── client_app.py   # Defines your ClientApp
│   ├── data_loading.py # MONAI transforms + datalist
│   ├── get_data.py     # Placeholder function for FLIP API, reads local data
│   ├── server_app.py   # Defines your ServerApp
│   └── task.py         # Defines model creation
├── pyproject.toml      # Project metadata like dependencies and configs
└── README.md
```

## Running this tutorial

> **Run this tutorial with the Docker Compose stack, not `flwr run` / the
> Simulation Engine.** The compose stack is the supported path; the
> simulation path is documented below only so you understand why we avoid it.

### Recommended: Docker Compose

From the Flower service directory:

```bash
cd fl-services/flower
make build                # build the fl-base / superlink / supernode images
make up                   # start fl-api, superlink, supernode-1, supernode-2
```

Then submit the run against the `fl-api` control plane:

```bash
make submit APP=3d_spleen_segmentation    # from fl-services/flower/
```

The default stack publishes no host ports; `make submit` execs into the fl-api
container. To POST from the host instead, publish the fl-api port by editing
the compose file and re-running `make up`.

The dev compose stack (`deploy/compose.development.yml` +
`deploy/compose.development.flower.yml`) wires everything correctly:

- `DEV_DATAFRAME`, `DEV_IMAGES_DIR`, `WORKING_DIR`
  are resolved from `.env.development` (read by Docker Compose as the
  `${VAR}` substitutions in each service's `volumes:` block) and bind-mounted
  into the SuperNode and SuperLink containers — one source of truth for paths.
- Inside the containers the mounts always land at stable locations
  (`/images`, `/dataframe_file`, `/app/runs`, `/app/model_checkpoints`), and
  the `environment:` blocks point the app at those paths, so relative paths in
  tutorial code resolve consistently regardless of your host layout.
- The SuperLink's `--insecure` mode and health server are set by `command:`,
  not by your shell — nothing to re-export between runs.

### Not recommended: Flower Simulation Engine (`flwr run`)

We deliberately do **not** document a `flwr run` invocation for this tutorial.
Running it via the Simulation Engine is technically possible but brittle, for
reasons specific to this project:

1. **Long-lived `flower-superlink` caches its environment.** `flwr run`
   submits jobs to an already-running `flower-superlink` daemon. Ray worker
   subprocesses inherit the superlink's env, *not* the env you exported on the
   `flwr run` command line — so changing `DEV_DATAFRAME=…` between runs has
   no effect until you `pkill -f flower-superlink`.
2. **ClientApp CWD is not your project directory.** `flwr run` installs a
   snapshot of the app under `~/.flwr/apps/<publisher>.<name>.<version>.<hash>/`
   and runs ClientApp subprocesses from there, so relative paths like
   `../../data/...` resolve to `~/.flwr/data/...` and fail.
3. **FLIP's `DevSettings` singleton is pinned at import time.**
   `flip/constants/pt_constants.py` reads `FlipConstants.LOCAL_DEV` at
   class-body time, which forces pydantic-settings to materialise the
   singleton before any run starts. Once pinned, later `os.environ[...]`
   writes don't propagate, so mid-run path overrides are a dead end.

Under Docker Compose none of these bite: each container starts fresh, env
vars are applied from `env_file`/`environment:` at container start, and CWDs
are fixed by `working_dir:`.

If you still want to experiment with `flwr run` locally you will have to
(a) `pkill -f flower-superlink` before every run with new env, (b) use
absolute paths (`$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/data/...`), and (c) accept
that some FLIP-side behaviour driven by the import-time singleton will still
reflect whatever env the superlink was born with. Don't do it for real work —
use the compose stack above.

## Best-model selection

This tutorial keeps the **best-scoring global model**, not just the last one — a 30-round run has plenty of
room to peak early and drift afterwards. Two run-config keys drive it, in `app/config.toml` for
platform-submitted runs and `[tool.flwr.app.config]` in `pyproject.toml` for local `flwr run`:

```toml
best-model-metric = "test_dice"
best-model-metric-minimize = false
```

`test_dice` is the aggregated test Dice that `app/client_app.py` already reports from its evaluate pass; the
server weight-averages it across trusts by `num-examples` and keeps the round that scores highest.

What changes when it is set:

- The evaluate phase runs **every round** instead of only the last, so each round's freshly aggregated model
  is actually measured — 30 test-split inference passes per client rather than 1. That is the cost of
  selection here; drop the metric to `""` to go back to final-round-only evaluation.
- The results zip gains `best_FL_global_model.pt` next to `FL_global_model.pt`, in the same format, and
  `cross_val_results.json` gains `best_model` / `best_round` / `best_metric`. Nothing is fabricated: with no
  selection, or if the best-model write fails, the file and those keys are simply absent.
- The key must be one the clients actually report. Name a key nobody emits and the run completes with no
  best model at all, logging a warning per round rather than failing — check the ServerApp log if the
  artefact is missing.

## Differential privacy

Training updates are privatised **on the SuperNode**, before the reply leaves the trust. The
`flip_local_dp_mod` mod from
[`flip.flower.privacy`](../../../flip-utils/flip/flower/privacy.py) clips the local update to a
fixed L2 norm and adds Gaussian noise scaled to the configured budget:

```
sigma = dp-sensitivity * sqrt(2 * ln(1.25 / dp-delta)) / dp-epsilon
```

It is wired in `app/client_app.py` as `@app.train(mods=[flip_local_dp_mod])`, so it covers training
rounds only — `@app.evaluate` is untouched. That mirrors the scope of the NVFLARE apps'
`PercentilePrivacy` result filter, though the mechanism is stronger: NVFLARE sparsifies by
percentile and adds no noise, while this is a real (epsilon, delta) mechanism built on Flower's own
`compute_clip_model_update` / `add_gaussian_noise_inplace`.

| Key                | Default | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|---------|
| `dp-enabled`       | `true`  | Master switch. `false` makes the mod a pass-through, so DP-on / DP-off runs use an identical app |
| `dp-clipping-norm` | `1.0`   | L2 norm the update is clipped to before noise |
| `dp-sensitivity`   | `1e-4`  | How much one training example can move the update |
| `dp-epsilon`       | `10.0`  | Privacy budget — smaller means more privacy and more noise |
| `dp-delta`         | `1e-5`  | Probability the guarantee fails outright |

Override per run without editing the app:

```bash
flwr run . --run-config "dp-enabled=false"
flwr run . --run-config "dp-epsilon=1.0 dp-clipping-norm=0.5"
```

> ⚠️ **The defaults are demonstration values, chosen utility-first** so this tutorial still
> converges with the mechanism live (they give sigma ≈ 4.8e-5). They are **not** a defensible
> privacy budget. A real one calibrates `dp-sensitivity` to the local dataset — roughly
> `2 * dp-clipping-norm / |D|` for an average-of-examples update — and accounts for composition
> across rounds, which this mod does not do: every round spends the budget again. With only a
> handful of trusts the noise also does not average down the way central DP's does.

Integer entries in the state dict (BatchNorm's `num_batches_tracked` counters) pass through
unprivatised. They are step counts rather than learned parameters, and Flower's clipping scales
each array in place by a float, which numpy refuses to write back into an int array — so the mod
excludes them rather than crashing the client the first time clipping engages.

## Running on a real FLIP project: data enrichment

Everything above runs against **local** data. On a real FLIP project the images come from each Trust's
PACS — and PACS supply images only. A segmentation mask is a 3D volume with nowhere to live in OMOP, so
the labels must be uploaded into each Trust's XNAT before training. That is the platform's **data
enrichment** stage.

(Contrast the chest X-ray classification tutorial, whose labels *are* in OMOP: its cohort query projects
them as dataframe columns and it needs no enrichment. See the Data Enrichment user guide.)

Each label must land in the **same scan's `NIFTI` resource** as its image, named to match — the app
pairs them by filename, substituting `/input_` with `/label_`. Run the upload **after the image pull and
after DICOM-to-NIfTI conversion**.

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials download-spleen-data FL_BACKEND=flower

export XNAT_HOST=https://xnat.trust.example
export XNAT_USER=your-username
export XNAT_PASS=your-password

make -C fl-tutorials upload-spleen-labels FL_BACKEND=flower FLIP_PROJECT_ID=<project-uuid> \
  XNAT_URLS="http://127.0.0.1:8104 http://127.0.0.1:8106" DRY_RUN=1
```

`DRY_RUN=1` reports what would happen without changing anything — do that first, then drop it to upload.
One invocation covers every Trust in `XNAT_URLS` (above, the dev roster: GSTT on 8104, KCH on 8106), which
matters because each Trust's XNAT holds only its own studies and a Trust left without labels fails training.

> **This tutorial's download covers only part of the cohort.** `download-spleen-data FL_BACKEND=flower`
> pulls a fixed 6-case HF snapshot and ignores `NUM_CASES`, while the accession mapping spans 41. Enriching
> from it succeeds but leaves most of the cohort unlabelled, and the command says so. For full coverage use
> the NVFLARE download (`make -C fl-tutorials/nvflare download-spleen-data NUM_CASES=41`) and point
> `SPLEEN_LABELS_DIR` at it — the labels are backend-agnostic once they are in XNAT.

Enrichment is **backend-agnostic**: the labels live in XNAT, so a project enriched once can be trained by
either backend. This target deliberately delegates to the single copy of the upload script in
`fl-tutorials/nvflare/image_segmentation/3d_spleen_segmentation/utils/`, passing this tutorial's own data
directory — see that tutorial's README for the full walkthrough and options.

## Data Location

By default, the app reads from:

- `data/sample_get_dataframe_response.csv`
- `data/accession-resources`
