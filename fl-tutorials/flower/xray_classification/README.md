# Chest-X-ray multi-lesion classification (Flower)

Flower port of the chest-X-ray tutorial that lives at
`fl-tutorials/nvflare/image_classification/xray_classification`. It scores
every X-ray against the lesions named in `app/config.json` (Effusion + Edema
by default, with "Lungs in normal arrangement" as a negative override) using
a MONAI DenseNet121 trained with multi-label BCE.

The cohort query (`query.sql`) is copied verbatim from the NVFLARE tutorial
and matches the chest-X-ray data seeded into the trust mock OMOP DB
(concept ids 4215818 / 4196943 / 40481136). This is the tutorial that
`make e2e_smoke` from FLIP picks when `FL_BACKEND=flower`.

```

`server_app.py` and `strategy.py` are copies of the canonical `standard`
Flower base bundle at [`fl-apps/flower/standard/app/`](../../../fl-apps/flower/standard/app).
They live here so that `flwr run` from this tutorial can resolve
`app.server_app` / `app.strategy` locally — FLIP's
`bundle_flower_application` overlays the same base files at deploy time, so
the upload flow is unaffected.

## Running this tutorial

> **Run this tutorial with the Docker Compose stack, not `flwr run` / the
> Simulation Engine.** The compose stack is the supported path; the
> simulation path is documented below only so you understand why we avoid it.

### Recommended: Docker Compose

From the Flower service directory:

```bash
cd fl-services/flower
make build                # build the fl-base / superlink / supernode images
make up                   # start fl-api, superlink, supernode-1, supernode-2
```

Then submit the run against the `fl-api` control plane:

```bash
make submit APP=xray_classification    # from fl-services/flower/
```

The dev compose stack (`deploy/compose.development.yml` +
`deploy/compose.development.flower.yml`) wires everything correctly:

- `DEV_DATAFRAME`, `DEV_IMAGES_DIR`, `WORKING_DIR`
  are resolved from `.env.development` (read by Docker Compose as the
  `${VAR}` substitutions in each service's `volumes:` block) and bind-mounted
  into the SuperNode and SuperLink containers — one source of truth for paths.
- Inside the containers the mounts always land at stable locations
  (`/images`, `/dataframe_file`, `/app/runs`, `/app/model_checkpoints`), and
  the `environment:` blocks point the app at those paths, so relative paths in
  tutorial code resolve consistently regardless of your host layout.
- The SuperLink's `--insecure` mode and health server are set by `command:`,
  not by your shell — nothing to re-export between runs.

The `DEV_DATAFRAME` CSV must expose chest-X-ray accession IDs with the same
column shape `query.sql` returns from the trust mock OMOP DB (concept ids
4215818 / 4196943 / 40481136). DICOMs land in `DEV_IMAGES_DIR` keyed by
accession number — `flip.get_by_accession_number(..., resource_type=[ResourceType.DICOM])`
reads them directly when `LOCAL_DEV=true`.

### Not recommended: Flower Simulation Engine (`flwr run`)

We deliberately do **not** document a `flwr run` invocation for this tutorial.
Running it via the Simulation Engine is technically possible but brittle, for
reasons specific to this project:

1. **Long-lived `flower-superlink` caches its environment.** `flwr run`
   submits jobs to an already-running `flower-superlink` daemon. Ray worker
   subprocesses inherit the superlink's env, *not* the env you exported on the
   `flwr run` command line — so changing `DEV_DATAFRAME=…` between runs has
   no effect until you `pkill -f flower-superlink`.
2. **ClientApp CWD is not your project directory.** `flwr run` installs a
   snapshot of the app under `~/.flwr/apps/<publisher>.<name>.<version>.<hash>/`
   and runs ClientApp subprocesses from there, so relative paths like
   `../../data/...` resolve to `~/.flwr/data/...` and fail.
3. **FLIP's `DevSettings` singleton is pinned at import time.**
   `flip/constants/pt_constants.py` reads `FlipConstants.LOCAL_DEV` at
   class-body time, which forces pydantic-settings to materialise the
   singleton before any run starts. Once pinned, later `os.environ[...]`
   writes don't propagate, so mid-run path overrides are a dead end.

Under Docker Compose none of these bite: each container starts fresh, env
vars are applied from `env_file`/`environment:` at container start, and CWDs
are fixed by `working_dir:`.

If you still want to experiment with `flwr run` locally you will have to
(a) `pkill -f flower-superlink` before every run with new env, (b) use
absolute paths (`$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/data/...`), and (c) accept
that some FLIP-side behaviour driven by the import-time singleton will still
reflect whatever env the superlink was born with. Don't do it for real work —
use the compose stack above.

## Hyperparameters

`app/config.json` mirrors the NVFLARE chest-X-ray config:

| Key                  | Default | Meaning |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| `LOCAL_ROUNDS`       | 3       | Local epochs per global round |
| `LR_START` / `LR_END`| 1e-3 / 1e-4 | ExponentialLR sweep across the local round |
| `VAL_SPLIT`          | 0.2     | Validation fraction |
| `TEST_SPLIT`         | 0.2     | Test fraction (used by `@app.evaluate`) |
| `BATCH_SIZE`         | 8       | DataLoader batch size |
| `LESIONS`            | Effusion / Edema / "Lungs in normal arrangement" | Multi-label heads + the normal-override column |
| `value_to_numerical` | {0:"No",1:"Yes"} | Maps dataframe string values to binary labels |
| `VALIDATE_EVERY`     | 1       | Validate every N epochs (currently always 1) |

## Best-model selection

This tutorial keeps the **best-scoring global model**, not just the last one. Two run-config keys drive it —
`app/config.toml` for platform-submitted runs, `[tool.flwr.app.config]` in `pyproject.toml` for local
`flwr run`:

```toml
best-model-metric = "test_f1-score"
best-model-metric-minimize = false
```

`test_f1-score` is the **macro F1 across lesions** that `app/client_app.py` reports from its evaluate pass
(`macro_mean` in `app/task.py`), matching the macro `VAL-F1-SCORE` the NVFLARE chest-X-ray tutorial selects
on. The server weight-averages it across trusts by `num-examples` and keeps the round that scores highest.

What changes when it is set:

- The evaluate phase runs **every round** instead of only the last, so each round's freshly aggregated model
  is actually measured. That is why `num-server-rounds` is 3 here (4 on the platform) — a one-round job's
  "best" model is by definition its final one.
- The results zip gains `best_FL_global_model.pt` next to `FL_global_model.pt`, in the same format, and
  `cross_val_results.json` gains `best_model` / `best_round` / `best_metric`. Nothing is fabricated: with no
  selection, or if the best-model write fails, the file and those keys are simply absent.

Two things worth knowing before you change the metric:

- **The key must be one the clients actually report.** Name a key nobody emits and the run completes with no
  best model at all, logging a warning per round rather than failing — check the ServerApp log if the
  artefact is missing.
- **On Flower the metric is measured on the test split**, because that is what the evaluate phase uses here.
  NVFLARE instead scores a pre-training pass over the *validation* split. Selecting on the test split is
  convenient for a tutorial but is a mild form of selection-on-test; point `best-model-metric` at a
  validation metric if you need the split kept clean.

## Differential privacy

Training updates are privatised **on the SuperNode**, before the reply leaves the trust. The
`flip_local_dp_mod` mod from
[`flip.flower.privacy`](../../../flip-utils/flip/flower/privacy.py) clips the local update to a
fixed L2 norm and adds Gaussian noise scaled to the configured budget:

```
sigma = dp-sensitivity * sqrt(2 * ln(1.25 / dp-delta)) / dp-epsilon
```

It is wired in `app/client_app.py` as `@app.train(mods=[flip_local_dp_mod])`, so it covers training
rounds only — `@app.evaluate` is untouched. That mirrors the scope of the NVFLARE apps'
`PercentilePrivacy` result filter, though the mechanism is stronger: NVFLARE sparsifies by
percentile and adds no noise, while this is a real (epsilon, delta) mechanism built on Flower's own
`compute_clip_model_update` / `add_gaussian_noise_inplace`.

| Key                | Default | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|---------|
| `dp-enabled`       | `true`  | Master switch. `false` makes the mod a pass-through, so DP-on / DP-off runs use an identical app |
| `dp-clipping-norm` | `1.0`   | L2 norm the update is clipped to before noise |
| `dp-sensitivity`   | `1e-4`  | How much one training example can move the update |
| `dp-epsilon`       | `10.0`  | Privacy budget — smaller means more privacy and more noise |
| `dp-delta`         | `1e-5`  | Probability the guarantee fails outright |

Override per run without editing the app:

```bash
flwr run . --run-config "dp-enabled=false"
flwr run . --run-config "dp-epsilon=1.0 dp-clipping-norm=0.5"
```

> ⚠️ **The defaults are demonstration values, chosen utility-first** so this tutorial still
> converges with the mechanism live (they give sigma ≈ 4.8e-5). They are **not** a defensible
> privacy budget. A real one calibrates `dp-sensitivity` to the local dataset — roughly
> `2 * dp-clipping-norm / |D|` for an average-of-examples update — and accounts for composition
> across rounds, which this mod does not do: every round spends the budget again. With only a
> handful of trusts the noise also does not average down the way central DP's does.

Integer entries in the state dict (BatchNorm's `num_batches_tracked` counters) pass through
unprivatised. They are step counts rather than learned parameters, and Flower's clipping scales
each array in place by a float, which numpy refuses to write back into an int array — so the mod
excludes them rather than crashing the client the first time clipping engages.

## Data assumptions

- `query.sql` resolves chest-X-ray accession IDs labeled with effusion / edema
  / normal lungs from the trust mock OMOP DB.
- DICOM payloads come back via `flip.get_by_accession_number(..., resource_type=[ResourceType.DICOM])`.
- Each `.dcm` becomes one training sample with the row's lesion labels.
