# fl-tutorials tests

CPU-only pytest suite over the tutorial apps' transform chains. No GPU, no dataset download, no FL
image, no network — the fixtures are synthetic DICOMs built in-process, and the whole suite runs in
a couple of seconds.

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials test        # ruff over fl-tutorials/ + this suite
make -C fl-tutorials pytest      # this suite only
make -C fl-tutorials lint        # ruff only
```

CI runs the same two commands on every pull request touching `fl-tutorials/**` or the flip-utils
source/environment, and on pushes to main/develop (`.github/workflows/fl-tutorials-tests.yml`),
for both backends.

## Why this exists

A preprocessing defect fed the Ark+ foundation model **sideways** radiographs. It survived three
apps and two attempted fixes (`Rotate90d`, then `Flipd` — neither of which can undo a transpose),
depressing every reported metric without erroring: worst case, Pneumothorax AUROC 0.642 against
0.972 on the same checkpoint and cohort. It was found by hand (FLIP#821, FLIP#812, FLIP#820).

Nothing committed could have caught it. Visual review was structurally incapable of doing so: the
one verification artefact in the tree, `arkplus_fine_tuning/docs/make_dataset_figure.py`, reads
pixels through `pydicom` directly, so the published dataset figure showed perfectly upright
radiographs while the model was being fed the transpose.

## What it runs

The environment is **flip-utils'** (`flip-utils[full]` — monai, pydicom, torch, timm, sklearn),
which is what the FL images give these apps at runtime. There is deliberately no `pyproject.toml`
here: the per-tutorial `uv` environments are the wrong target (`arkplus_fine_tuning/pyproject.toml`
does not even declare `monai`, so that environment cannot import its own `data_utils.py`), and one
shared environment matching the runtime is both cheaper and more faithful.

Every app on the MONAI `LoadImaged` DICOM path is covered, both backends — the five entries in
`DICOM_APPS` (`tutorial_apps.py`). Each app's chain is fetched from the app's own factory, not
reconstructed here, so the test asserts on the shipped code.

| Test | Asserts |
| --- | --- |
| `test_phantom_has_no_dihedral_symmetry` | The fixture is non-square **and** distinguishable from all eight of its dihedral variants. |
| `test_phantom_dicom_round_trips` | Each synthetic encoding decodes back to the phantom. |
| `test_loader_prefix_matches_pixel_data` | The chain up to the first resampling transform is `np.array_equal` to `pydicom`'s `PixelData`. |
| `test_full_chain_orientation_is_identity` | The full chain's output correlates best with the **unrotated, unflipped** reference, by a margin — for **both** the validation chain and the (seeded) training chain, so an orientation "fix" landing in the training-only branch fails too. |
| `test_registry_covers_every_dicom_load_site` | Every `LoadImaged` site in the tree is either registered in `DICOM_APPS` or on the documented `Orientationd` NIfTI path — a new DICOM app cannot land silently uncovered. The walk also asserts it reached the registered apps, so a skip filter that empties it fails rather than passing vacuously. |
| `test_monai_deprecations_escalate_to_errors` | `pytest.ini`'s blanket `ignore::` lines still leave MONAI's own deprecations escalated to errors — the notice that a pinned reader convention is about to change must not rejoin the ignored torch/numpy noise. |
| `test_loader_pins_its_reader` | The chain names `PydicomReader(swap_ij=False)` instead of inheriting a reader. |
| `test_chain_composes` / `test_validation_chain_is_deterministic` | Both chains import, compose, run, and the validation chain is reproducible. |

Three design points are load-bearing, and each is itself asserted rather than assumed:

- **The assertion is on values, never on shape.** `Rotate90d(k=-1)` restores the correct shape and
  is still wrong — upright but mirrored, which swaps the patient's left and right and looks
  entirely correct.
- **The full-chain check correlates rather than compares.** The chain's output is `(3, N, N)`
  float32, resized and ImageNet-normalised; the reference is `(H, W)` uint16. Correlation against
  all eight dihedral variants is invariant to both, and names the defect ("looks like transpose")
  in the failure message.
- **The fixture is asymmetric under all eight dihedral transforms**, not merely non-square. A
  mirror-symmetric phantom passes a `Flipd`; a monotone gradient correlates with its own transpose.

The fixture is synthesised, not committed: ~12 KB against ~640 KB for a downsampled real study, no
provenance or PHI question, and the identical code path — the axis order is a property of the
reader's convention, wholly independent of pixel content. It is parametrised over `MONOCHROME1`,
`MONOCHROME2` and RLE Lossless, where the array path genuinely differs.

## What it does **not** cover

This is a check on axis order and chain composition. It is not coverage of the DICOM loading
contract, and should not be mistaken for it. Untested here:

- `MONOCHROME1` polarity inversion (the fixture is parametrised over it, but the assertions are
  orientation-only — `correlation()` takes an absolute value precisely so polarity does not enter).
- `RescaleSlope` / `RescaleIntercept` application.
- VOI LUT / window-level handling.
- Signed pixel data (`PixelRepresentation = 1`).
- Multi-frame instances.
- Whether "matches `PixelData`" is the same thing as "matches Ark+'s pretraining convention".
- End-to-end training behaviour, which stays with the GPU simulator harness
  (`make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial`).

**Out of scope by design:** the spleen and latent-diffusion tutorials. They load 3-D NIfTI through
`Orientationd`/`Spacingd`, where this correction would be actively wrong. Do not add them to
`DICOM_APPS`.

Tutorials are copy-and-adapt example code, and a repository test cannot follow a copy out of the
repository. It can keep the thing being copied correct, which is the point: `fl-apps/` (the
templates flip-api actually bundles) contains no image-loading code at all, so `fl-tutorials/` is
the reference implementation everyone starts from.
