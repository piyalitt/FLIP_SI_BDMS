"""Synthetic chest-radiograph-shaped DICOMs, and the dihedral algebra the tests assert with.

The fixture is synthesised rather than committed: a phantom is ~12 KB against ~640 KB for a
downsampled real study, it raises no provenance or PHI question, and it exercises the identical
code path — the transpose these tests pin is a property of the reader's axis convention, wholly
independent of pixel content.

Two properties of the phantom are load-bearing, and :func:`assert_dihedrally_asymmetric` checks
both rather than leaving them to inspection:

* **Non-square.** A square phantom makes a transpose shape-preserving, so the very defect under
  test would slip through anything that looks at shapes.
* **Asymmetric under all eight dihedral transforms**, not merely non-square. A mirror-symmetric
  phantom passes a ``Flipd`` unchanged; a monotone gradient correlates almost perfectly with its
  own transpose. The glyph below is an "F" — the conventional orientation marker, chosen because
  no rotation or reflection of it maps onto any other.
