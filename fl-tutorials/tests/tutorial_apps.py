"""The tutorial apps under test, and how to reach their transform chains.

Tutorial apps are loose scripts, not packages: an app's ``app_files/`` directory is copied whole
into a job and imported flat, so nothing here is importable by dotted name. Each entry is loaded
from its file path under a unique module name, which also keeps the three same-named
``data_utils`` modules from colliding in ``sys.modules``.

**Scope.** Only apps that read 2-D DICOM through MONAI's ``LoadImaged`` belong here. The spleen and
latent-diffusion tutorials load 3-D NIfTI through ``Orientationd``/``Spacingd``, where the
axis-order correction these tests pin would be actively wrong — they are deliberately absent.
