"""Pin what the DICOM tutorial apps actually feed their models.

A preprocessing bug that fed a foundation model sideways radiographs survived three apps and two
attempted fixes, depressing every reported metric without ever erroring (FLIP#821). Nothing in the
repository could have caught it: the only committed verification artefact read pixels through
``pydicom`` directly, so the published dataset figure showed upright radiographs while the model
was being fed the transpose.

These tests close that gap from two directions:

* :func:`test_loader_prefix_matches_pixel_data` compares the chain *up to the first resampling
  transform* against ``pydicom``'s ``PixelData``, bit for bit.
* :func:`test_full_chain_orientation_is_identity` runs the whole chain and correlates the result
  against all eight dihedral variants of the reference, asserting ``identity`` wins. Correlation
  is invariant to the resize and normalisation the full chain applies, and names the defect
  ("looks like transpose") rather than only reporting that two arrays differ.

Neither assertion is on shape. ``Rotate90d(k=-1)`` restores the correct shape and is still wrong —
upright but mirrored, which swaps the patient's left and right and looks entirely correct.
