# Ark+ Fine-tuning — Chest X-ray Classification

FLIP tutorial for **federated fine-tuning** of an Ark+ Swin foundation model on chest X-ray
classification, using the NVFLARE **Client API** (`nvflare.client`). It replaces the earlier
Executor-based implementation that used to live here: the finetuning semantics are unchanged (frozen
backbone, fresh 5-class head, local teacher/student EMA), only the FL plumbing was ported from the
legacy Executor API to the Client API. The job is defined entirely in Python via
[`FlipFedAvgRecipe`](../../../../flip-utils/flip/nvflare/recipes/flip_fedavg_recipe.py) in
[`job.py`](job.py) — no hand-written server/client JSON.

## Compatible job type

`config.json["job_type"] = "standard"`. Each client runs [`app_files/trainer.py`](app_files/trainer.py)
as an in-process Client-API script (`flare.init()` → `flare.receive()`/`flare.send()` round loop) via
NVFLARE's `InProcessClientAPIExecutor`. There is **no `validator.py`** — the held-out validation folds
into the trainer's `flare.is_evaluate()` branch (server-driven cross-site evaluation).

## Target labels

The five DECAF chest X-ray lesions are predicted by a single classifier head:

```json
"LESIONS": {
  "0": "Effusion",
  "1": "Consolidation",
  "2": "Infiltration",
  "3": "Lung Nodule or Mass",
  "4": "Pneumothorax",
  "-1": "Lungs in normal arrangement"
}
```

`Lungs in normal arrangement` is a negative override: when it is positive, all lesion labels for that
row are treated as negative. Labels come from the per-site dataframe (see Dataset setup).

## Model & Ark+ integration

NVFLARE's persistor loads `models.get_model` from [`app_files/models.py`](app_files/models.py).
`get_model()` builds an `ArkSwinTransformer` (in [`app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py`](app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py))
sized from the `ARKPLUS` block, loads the backbone from the checkpoint with `LOAD_BACKBONE_ONLY=true`
(the heads start fresh), and wraps it in `ArkPlusNVFlareWrapper` (which adapts Ark+'s
`model(images, head_id) -> (features, logits)` to the `model(images) -> logits` interface, and exposes
`forward_with_features` for the teacher/student loop). The trainer freezes every parameter that is not
under `ark_model.omni_heads`, so only the classifier head trains.

### Teacher/student training

When `USE_TEACHER_STUDENT=true`, each client holds a trainable **student** (initialised from the
global weights) and a frozen EMA **teacher**. The per-step loss combines a BCE label loss with an MSE
feature-consistency loss between student and teacher embeddings, weighted by `CONSISTENCY_WEIGHT`.
Only the student weights are returned to NVFLARE; the teacher is never aggregated.

## Finetuning mechanisms

Three optimisations keep the frozen-backbone round-trip cheap. They are driven by keys in
`config.json` and are exercised **locally** (the recipe in `job.py` wires them) and **on deploy** (the
fl-server injects the equivalent filters from the same keys at job-assembly):

| Key | Effect | Component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SERVER_CHECKPOINT: "pretrained_weights.pt"` | The backbone-only checkpoint seeds the round-0 global model **server-side** and is broadcast to clients — it is never bundled into the client app. | `InitialCheckpointPTModelPersistor` |
| `AGGREGATE_ONLY_REGEX: "omni_heads"` | Clients return only the trainable head each round (not the ~759 MiB backbone). | `KeepOnlyVars` (client result filter) |
| _(same key)_ | After round 0 the server broadcasts only the head; clients rebuild the full model from it, so training code is unchanged and memory stays flat across rounds. | `TrimBroadcastVars` (server) + `ReconstructFullModel` (client) |

In the local simulator the backbone checkpoint is staged into the **server** custom dir only (see
`stage_app_files` in [`job.py`](job.py)); clients build a bare architecture and receive the backbone at
round 0.

## Configuration

Training settings live in [`app_files/config.json`](app_files/config.json): `GLOBAL_ROUNDS`,
`LOCAL_ROUNDS`, `LR_START`/`LR_END`, `VAL_SPLIT`/`SPLIT_SEED`, `BATCH_SIZE`, plus the `LESIONS`
and `ARKPLUS` blocks.

## Dataset setup

This app expects a DECAF-formatted chest X-ray dataset: a per-site CSV dataframe with `accession_id`
and the lesion-label columns, plus DICOM images.

The quickest path uses the published reference dataset on Hugging Face. From the repo root:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials download-arkplus-finetuning-data   # fetch + lay out data/arkplus/site{1,2}/
make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=arkplus_fine_tuning
```

`download-arkplus-finetuning-data` pulls the `site1`/`site2` training splits of
[`aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-classification`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-classification)
and normalises them into `fl-tutorials/nvflare/data/arkplus/site{1,2}/` (gitignored), matching this
tutorial's `.env.app` defaults (`SITE{1,2}_IMAGES_DIR` / `SITE{1,2}_DATAFRAME`). Requires a GPU + the
`flare-fl-base` image to run the simulator. To use your own data instead, point the per-site
`.env.app` values at it.

- **Simulator (`LOCAL_DEV=true`):** the two clients (`site-1`, `site-2`) train on distinct local data.
  The trainer selects a client's data by `flare.get_site_name()`; `app_files/data_utils.py` resolves
  the paths with the precedence `SITE{N}_IMAGES_DIR`/`SITE{N}_DATAFRAME` env → the single-site `DEV_*`
  env. The per-site env vars are set in [`.env.app`](.env.app).
- **Real deployment (`LOCAL_DEV=false`):** the cohort dataframe comes from
  `FLIP().get_dataframe(project_id, query)` and DICOMs from `FLIP().get_by_accession_number(...)`.
  `project_id` is passed to the trainer as `--project_id`; the cohort `query` is read from
  `config_fed_client.json` (see [`query.sql`](query.sql)).

### Example images

One representative radiograph per target lesion, left to right in classifier-head index order
(`Effusion` = 0 … `Pneumothorax` = 4):

![Representative chest radiograph for each of the five target lesions](docs/dataset_examples.png)

The first four panels are drawn from the site-2 training split; the pneumothorax panel is drawn from
the site-2 holdout split. Regenerate the figure with
[`docs/make_dataset_figure.py`](docs/make_dataset_figure.py), pointing `DATA_ROOT` at the directory
holding the dataset split folders:

```bash
make dataset-figure DATA_ROOT=/path/to/balanced_synthetic_split
```

It runs in the tutorial-local env with the `docs` extra (`matplotlib` + `pydicom`). Before drawing,
it checks each panel's lesion against `config.json` and each accession's labels against its split's
cohort dataframe, so a mislabelled figure fails rather than ships.

> **What this figure is and is not evidence of.** The panels are drawn from `pydicom`'s `PixelData`,
> not by running the app's transform chain. It once showed perfectly upright radiographs while the
> model was being fed the transpose of them (FLIP#821), so a figure that looks right is not by
> itself evidence that the model sees the same thing. The two are now tied together deliberately:
> `get_xray_transforms()` pins its reader to `PydicomReader(swap_ij=False)`, which returns the array
> exactly as `PixelData` stores it, and `fl-tutorials/tests/` asserts that bit-for-bit on every app
> on this path. **That test suite — not this figure — is what makes the panels representative.**

## Checkpoint setup

`make run`/`make export` require the backbone checkpoint at `app_files/pretrained_weights.pt`, produced
from the raw Ark6 output (`Ark6_swinLarge768_ep50.pth.tar`) by `make prepare-checkpoint` (a no-op if it
already exists). Fetch the raw checkpoint with `make download-raw-checkpoint`, or request access via
[this form](https://forms.gle/qkoDGXNiKRPTDdCe8); see [`process_tools/README.md`](process_tools/README.md).

## How to run

```bash
# Local NVFLARE simulator (GPU + DECAF data + checkpoint). Prepares the checkpoint, then runs job.py.
make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=arkplus_fine_tuning
#   ...or, from this directory:
make run RAW_CHECKPOINT=/path/to/Ark6_swinLarge768_ep50.pth.tar

# Export the full NVFLARE job under ./fl_job/flip_fedavg/ (no GPU needed)
make export
```

`NUM_ROUNDS` (default `3`) and `N_CLIENTS` (default `2`) parameterise both targets and propagate
through the tutorial harness:

```bash
make run NUM_ROUNDS=10                                                 # 10-round local simulation
make export NUM_ROUNDS=10 N_CLIENTS=3
make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=arkplus_fine_tuning NUM_ROUNDS=10
```

or pass the flags directly using the recipe syntax (the Makefile's `uv` environment — flip-utils with
the `full` extra — matches the deployed FL image; a bare `uv run` resolves to an env without
torch/nvflare):

```bash
uv run --project ../../../../flip-utils --extra full python job.py --n_clients 3 --num_rounds 10
```

> **Local knob only.** `--num_rounds` governs local simulation and export. In production the FL API
> reads `GLOBAL_ROUNDS` from `config.json` at submit time and overrides whatever `job.py` baked into
> the exported config — deployed round counts come from `config.json`, never from these flags.
> (The standalone NVFLARE submit path, `make -C fl-services/nvflare submit`, is not wired — run
> locally via the simulator, or exercise the platform path through the FLIP UI / `make e2e_smoke`.)

## Round metrics & platform comparison

After a simulator run, `make round-metrics` parses the FLIP `ScatterAndGather` controller events
(`Round N started/finished`, `Start/End aggregation`, `Contribution ... ACCEPTED`) from the
simulator server log — the same lines `scripts/fl_round_metrics/extract_platform_round_timings.sh` pulls from CloudWatch for
a deployed run — and writes the same artefacts (`rounds.tsv`, `summary.md`, a timing boxplot) under
`round_metrics/` in this directory:

```bash
make run NUM_ROUNDS=50            # full-length local replica (GPU, hours; smoke-test with the default 3 first)
make round-metrics                # -> round_metrics/simulator-<workspace>-<timestamp>/
make round-metrics COMPARE=/path/to/platform/rounds.tsv   # adds a platform − simulator overhead table
```

`COMPARE` takes a `rounds.tsv` produced by `scripts/fl_round_metrics/extract_platform_round_timings.sh` for a platform run of
this same app; the summary then includes a side-by-side steady-state table (round duration,
aggregation time, inter-round gap), i.e. a baseline for the overhead the platform adds over bare
local training. Knobs: `WORKSPACE` (simulator workspace parsed for logs; defaults to `job.py`'s
`/tmp/nvflare/arkplus_finetuning`) and `METRICS_OUT` (output base directory).

> **Interpretation caveat.** Both simulated clients share one host and one GPU
> (`num_threads = num_clients`), so simulator round durations bundle GPU contention between the two
> clients; the platform − simulator round-duration delta in turn bundles WAN transfer, platform
> orchestration, and hardware differences. The aggregation and inter-round-gap rows are the clean
> comparables — the generated `summary.md` spells this out.

### One-command cross-site replication

For a collaborating site reproducing the baseline (no FLIP hub or AWS access needed), a single
target chains the whole experiment — download the HF tutorial data (~6.3 GB) and the Ark+
checkpoint if missing, run the full-length simulator replica, extract the metrics, and pack
everything to send back:

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd FLIP/fl-tutorials/nvflare/image_classification/arkplus_fine_tuning
make reproduce-overhead          # hours on GPU; produces arkplus_sim_experiment_<host>_<stamp>.zip here
```

The bundle contains the metrics artefacts (`rounds.tsv`, `summary.md`, boxplot), the simulator
logs (model files excluded), and a `provenance/` folder (`config.json`, `.env.app`,
`host_info.txt` with GPU/OS/git-commit) so runs from different sites can be compared like-for-like.

Prerequisites: Linux with an NVIDIA GPU + drivers, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on `PATH`
(the first run builds the flip-utils environment automatically), internet access (Hugging Face +
Dropbox), and ~15 GB free disk. On a multi-GPU host pick a device with
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<n> make reproduce-overhead`. Knobs: `OVERHEAD_ROUNDS` (default `50`, the deployed
run's `GLOBAL_ROUNDS`). If the simulation finished but packing failed (or you want to re-send),
`make package-overhead-bundle` re-bundles the last run without re-simulating.

## Key files

- [`job.py`](job.py): builds `FlipFedAvgRecipe` (with `aggregate_only_regex`), stages `app_files/`
  (checkpoint → server only), and runs SimEnv / exports the job.
- [`app_files/trainer.py`](app_files/trainer.py): Client-API training loop — frozen backbone,
  teacher/student EMA, AMP, per-lesion metrics via `SummaryWriter`; returns the weight DIFF.
- [`app_files/models.py`](app_files/models.py): `get_model()` factory + `ArkPlusNVFlareWrapper`.
- [`app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py`](app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py): `ArkSwinTransformer` + `build_omni_model`.
- [`app_files/data_utils.py`](app_files/data_utils.py): data loading, per-site resolution, DICOM parsing, transforms.
- [`app_files/config.json`](app_files/config.json): model, training, finetuning and per-site data settings.

There is **no `validator.py`** — validation runs in the trainer's `flare.is_evaluate()` branch.

## Dependency note

The Ark+ model imports `timm`. If the FLIP/NVFLARE runtime does not include `timm`, model construction
fails — add it to the runtime dependencies, or set `ARKPLUS.REQUIRE_ARKPLUS_IMPORT=false` in
`config.json` only for a non-Ark fallback smoke test.
