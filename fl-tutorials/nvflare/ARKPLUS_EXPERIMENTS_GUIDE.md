# Running the Ark+ Experiments on FLIP

End-to-end runbook for the three Ark+ chest-X-ray experiments on a FLIP deployment
(validated on **AWS staging**: hub-only ECS Fargate + two on-desktop trusts, GSTT + KCH,
against the synthetic DeCaf MICCAI-2026 dataset).

## The three experiments

| # | Experiment | Tutorial dir (`fl-tutorials/nvflare/`) | Job type | Dataset | Cohort SQL discriminator |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Baseline evaluation** | `image_evaluation/arkplus_baseline_classification_evaluation` | `evaluation` | **holdout** | `procedure_source_value = 'Chest X-ray (holdout)'` |
| 2 | **Finetuning** | `image_classification/arkplus_fine_tuning` | `standard` (training) | **finetuning** (train split) | `procedure_source_value = 'Chest X-ray'` |
| 3 | **Multimodel evaluation** | `image_evaluation/arkplus_multimodel_classification_evaluation` | `evaluation` | **holdout** | `procedure_source_value = 'Chest X-ray (holdout)'` |

**Dependency:** the multimodel evaluation (3) evaluates the pretrained **and** the finetuned
checkpoint, so run finetuning (2) first and feed its output checkpoint into (3).

Each tutorial's `app_files/` carries the model code + `config.json`; the pretrained Ark+ weights
(`arkplus_pretrained_weights.pt`, ~759 MiB) ship in the baseline/multimodel `app_files/`. The
hub **de-bundles** these large checkpoints server-side (they are staged on the fl-server, never
shipped to clients — see FLIP#695), so the model-file upload cap must allow ~759 MiB
(`MAX_MODEL_FILE_BYTES`, default 5 GiB on the hub). The multimodel evaluation (3) additionally
requires the fl-server's `flip` package to **name its evaluation broadcasts**
(`EvaluationModelLocator` stamping `flip_eval_model_name` on each validate task's DXO meta) — the
evaluator attributes each broadcast's weights by that key and fails with a clear error on older
fl-server images.

> **⚠️ The finetuning checkpoint is different from the eval checkpoints — it must be _backbone-only_.**
> The **eval** experiments (1, 3) score the *full* foundation model, so their `pretrained_weights.pt`
> keeps the original 14-class `omni_heads.*`. **Finetuning (2)** loads only the Swin backbone and trains
> a **fresh 5-class head** (`NUM_CLASSES_LIST: [5]`, `LOAD_BACKBONE_ONLY: true`), so its
> `SERVER_CHECKPOINT` (`pretrained_weights.pt`) must have the `omni_heads.*` **stripped** — otherwise
> the server persistor's `strict=False` load hits a 14-vs-5 shape mismatch on `omni_heads.0` and the
> model goes straight to `ERROR` (see Troubleshooting). Produce the backbone-only file with the
> finetuning tutorial's `make prepare-checkpoint` (`process_tools/preprocess_checkpoints.py` strips the
> heads); **do not** just copy the eval tutorial's checkpoint across.

---

## Hardware & capacity requirements

These experiments are far heavier than a stock FLIP run — the Ark+ model is a `swin_large_384`
backbone run at 768 px, and the pretrained checkpoint is ~759 MiB (~1.5 GiB for the multimodel
variant). Several defaults sized for small models **must be raised**, or jobs OOM / time out.

**Central Hub (ECS Fargate) — sizes in `deploy/providers/AWS/ecs_tasks.tf`:**

| Task | Stock default | Ark+ requirement | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fl-api-net-1` | 0.5 vCPU / 1 GiB | **1 vCPU / 4 GiB** | Streams the 759 MiB checkpoint from S3 to the shared EFS volume; OOM-kills at 1 GiB |
| `fl-server-net-1` | 1 vCPU / 2 GiB | **2 vCPU / 8 GiB** | `torch.load`s the 759 MiB checkpoint as the initial/eval model; OOM-kills at 2 GiB (surfaces as `Server disconnected without sending a response` + a model `ERROR`) |

Also on the hub:
- **`MAX_MODEL_FILE_BYTES = 5 GiB`** (the current Settings default) — the presigned-POST upload
  cap must admit the ~759 MiB / ~1.5 GiB checkpoints.
- **Shared checkpoint-staging EFS volume** (`fl_checkpoints` access point) mounted at
  `/app/server-checkpoints` on **both** fl-api (writer) and fl-server (reader), with
  `SERVER_CHECKPOINT_ROOT` set — large checkpoints are staged server-side, never bundled into the
  client app (FLIP#695). Applies to eval `checkpoint`s **and** training `SERVER_CHECKPOINT`s.
- **Per-job GPU resource spec** in `.env.stag`: `JOB_RESOURCE_SPEC_NUM_GPUS=1`,
  `JOB_RESOURCE_SPEC_MEM_PER_GPU_IN_GIB=7`, so NVFLARE schedules the job onto a GPU.

**Trusts — both run on the GPU desktop, not the trust EC2:**
- **One CUDA GPU per trust**, ≥ ~8 GiB VRAM (the job requests 7 GiB/GPU), for `swin_large_384`
  @ 768 px + the 759 MiB model. The compose GPU overlay reserves a host GPU per fl-client. The
  trust EC2 (`t3.xlarge`) is **GPU-less** — the sole reason these experiments run the trusts on the
  desktop instead.
- **Disk** for the on-demand DICOM downloads (`trust/data/<KIT>/net-1`) plus the pulled studies in
  each trust's Orthanc + XNAT (the finetuning **train** cohort is ~1900 studies/site vs ~475 for
  the holdout).
- **Finetuning is compute-heavy**: 50 global × 2 local rounds × ~1900 studies/site of swin-large
  forward passes ≈ **several hours** per trust GPU even with the backbone frozen. Reduce
  `GLOBAL_ROUNDS` in the tutorial `config.json` for a quick end-to-end validation.

---

## Part A — Deploy the FLIP hub (AWS staging, ECS Fargate)

The Central Hub runs on **ECS Fargate** (flip-api + fl-api-net-1 + fl-server-net-1); the EC2 is a
bastion only. From `deploy/providers/AWS/` with the staging profile:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
export AWS_PROFILE=stag                 # must match; the Makefile enforces it
make aws-login                          # SSO
make plan  PROD=stag DEPLOY_TRUST_EC2=false   # hub-only (trusts run on the desktop)
make apply PROD=stag DEPLOY_TRUST_EC2=false   # run plan + apply as SEPARATE commands
make deploy-centralhub                  # roll the hub services to the develop tip (sha-<short7> task-def revisions)
make deploy-ui                          # ship the UI (S3 + CloudFront)
```

Image tags come from `.env.stag`: `DOCKER_TAG` (flip-api / flip-ui) and `DOCKER_FL_TAG`
(fl-api / fl-server / fl-client). GPU jobs need `JOB_RESOURCE_SPEC_NUM_GPUS`/
`JOB_RESOURCE_SPEC_MEM_PER_GPU_IN_GIB` in `.env.stag` (1 / 7 for Ark+).

**FL-task memory (important for Ark+):** the fl-api stages the 759 MiB checkpoint and the
fl-server torch-loads it, so `ecs_tasks.tf` sizes `fl-api-net-1` at **4 GiB** and
`fl-server-net-1` at **8 GiB** (1 GiB / 2 GiB OOM-kill on the Ark+ weights).

Verify: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://stag.flip.aicentre.co.uk/api/health` → `200`.

---

## Part B — Bring up the two trusts (on the GPU desktop)

Both trusts run on the desktop (they need the GPU the trust EC2 lacks). Prereqs: the trusts are
registered on the hub (`make register-trusts PROD=stag`) and the FL-server NLB admits the desktop's
public IP (`make allow-local-trust-nlb PROD=stag`). The DeCaf data itself is loaded into each
trust's Orthanc + OMOP **after** the trust containers are up — see
[Load the DeCaf dataset](#load-the-decaf-dataset-into-omop--orthanc) below.

**Two trusts on one host** — give each kit *distinct host-published ports* and point observability
at the in-repo config (the production compose defaults to an EC2 path). In `trust/.env.<KIT>.stag`:

```ini
# GSTT (Trust_1) uses 8001/8010/8020; give KCH (Trust_2) non-colliding ports:
IMAGING_API_PORT=8003
DATA_ACCESS_API_PORT=8012
TRUST_API_PORT=8022
# both kits, so alloy/loki/grafana mount the real configs:
OBSERVABILITY_CONFIG_DIR=/…/FLIP-Ark/trust/observability
```

Start them (XNAT's reset step needs `sudo`, so run in a real terminal or enable passwordless sudo):

```bash
env PROD=stag make -C trust up-trust KIT=GSTT
env PROD=stag make -C trust up-trust KIT=KCH
```

Verify both are polling the hub: `docker logs trust1-trust-api-1 --tail 3` should show
`GET https://stag.flip.aicentre.co.uk/api/tasks/pending "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`. XNAT is repopulated
from Orthanc on demand during the image pull, so a fresh XNAT is fine.

### Load the DeCaf dataset into OMOP + Orthanc

Once a trust's containers are up, its OMOP is an empty schema and its Orthanc is an empty PACS.
`scripts/load_xray_omop_dataset.py` on the `add-xray-omop-dataset-loader` branch populates both
from a DeCaf site folder in one pass — check that branch out (or cherry-pick the one script) to run
it; it isn't duplicated onto this branch. Per accession it writes the MI-CDM chain
(`person → visit_occurrence → procedure_occurrence → image_occurrence`) plus one
`image_feature`/`observation` pair per pathology label into OMOP, and uploads the DICOM to Orthanc
unchanged — the DICOM's own `AccessionNumber` becomes the OMOP `accession_id`, so imaging-api can
retrieve the study PACS-side by the same identifier `flip.get_dataframe` returns. It's idempotent
(safe to re-run) and reads DB/PACS credentials straight from a trust kit file via `--env-file`.

The DeCaf `balanced_synthetic_split/` ships one **train** folder and one **holdout** folder per
site (`re_final_site<N>` / `re_final_site<N>_holdoff`) — this is exactly the train-vs-holdout split
the three experiments key off (see the cohort-discriminator column in the experiments table at the
top): the loader auto-tags any folder whose name contains `holdoff`/`holdout` with the distinct
`procedure_source_value = 'Chest X-ray (holdout)'`, and everything else with `'Chest X-ray'`. Load
both folders for each site, mapping site → trust (site1 → GSTT/Trust_1, site2 → KCH/Trust_2):

```bash
DATA=~/data/DeCaf_MICCAI_2026/balanced_synthetic_split   # adjust to your local copy

# GSTT / Trust_1 — train + holdout
uv run scripts/load_xray_omop_dataset.py \
  --folder "$DATA/re_final_site1" \
  --env-file trust/.env.GSTT.stag --trust-label Trust_1

uv run scripts/load_xray_omop_dataset.py \
  --folder "$DATA/re_final_site1_holdoff" \
  --env-file trust/.env.GSTT.stag --trust-label Trust_1

# KCH / Trust_2 — train + holdout (folder names follow the same site<N>[_holdoff] pattern)
uv run scripts/load_xray_omop_dataset.py \
  --folder "$DATA/re_final_site2" \
  --env-file trust/.env.KCH.stag --trust-label Trust_2

uv run scripts/load_xray_omop_dataset.py \
  --folder "$DATA/re_final_site2_holdoff" \
  --env-file trust/.env.KCH.stag --trust-label Trust_2
```

`--env-file` reads `OMOP_POSTGRES_USER`/`_PASSWORD`/`_DB` + `OMOP_DB_PORT` (must be the
write-capable role, not `DATA_ACCESS_*`) and `ORTHANC_USERNAME`/`_PASSWORD` + `PACS_UI_PORT` from
the kit; hosts default to `localhost` (override with `--db-host`/`--orthanc-host` for a different
topology than "loader running on the same desktop as the trust containers"). Useful flags for a
quick check before committing to a full load: `--dry-run` (report without writing), `--limit N`
(first N accessions only), `--skip-omop` / `--skip-orthanc` (populate one side only).

---

## Part C — Run an experiment (e2e driver)

The `flip-api/tests/e2e_smoke.py` harness drives the full lifecycle (create project → cohort →
image pull → upload app + checkpoint → train/eval → wait). It talks only to the hub API, so it can
target **staging** via `FLIP_E2E_BASE_URL`.

**Auth on staging:** the harness authenticates as the admin via Cognito. Staging disables MFA
(`ENFORCE_MFA=false` on the flip-api task + the admin user's TOTP disabled) so password auth works.
Because the flip-api Makefile force-loads `.env.development`, **force the stag Cognito values on the
command line** so they override it:

```bash
cd flip-api
TUT=../.claude/worktrees/arkplus-apps-atb-2/fl-tutorials/nvflare   # adjust to your tutorial checkout

AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=eu-west-2_WdbAxJrH3 \
AWS_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID=bb4qqejptnt3bac342itt7n0f \
AWS_REGION=eu-west-2 AWS_PROFILE=stag \
ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD="$(grep '^ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=' ../.env.stag | cut -d= -f2-)" \
FLIP_E2E_BASE_URL=https://stag.flip.aicentre.co.uk/api \
DB_HOST=localhost \
.venv/bin/python -m tests.e2e_smoke \
  --model-files-dir "$TUT/image_evaluation/arkplus_baseline_classification_evaluation/app_files" \
  --query-file     "$TUT/image_evaluation/arkplus_baseline_classification_evaluation/query.sql" \
  --project-name "Ark+ Baseline Eval" \
  --model-name   "Ark+ Baseline Eval" \
  --no-dicom-to-nifti \
  --training-start-timeout 1200
```

Key flags (all optional, sensible defaults):

- `--project-name` / `--model-name` — name each experiment distinctly (reused per run).
- `--no-dicom-to-nifti` — the Ark+ apps read DICOMs directly (`ResourceType.ALL`); disable the
  XNAT dcm2niix conversion. **Set at project creation; immutable afterwards** (the edit-project
  form shows it read-only).
- `--project-id <UUID>` — reuse an already-approved project to **skip cohort submission + the
  image pull** (printed as `project_id=…` on the first run); great for iterating on training/eval
  code without re-pulling ~6 min of DICOM per backend.
- `--training-start-timeout 1200` — large-checkpoint jobs (upload + de-bundle) exceed the 300 s
  default; give them 1200 s.

### The three experiments (swap the tutorial + name)

```bash
# 1) Baseline evaluation — holdout dataset
--model-files-dir "$TUT/image_evaluation/arkplus_baseline_classification_evaluation/app_files" \
--query-file     "$TUT/image_evaluation/arkplus_baseline_classification_evaluation/query.sql" \
--project-name "Ark+ Baseline Eval" --model-name "Ark+ Baseline Eval"

# 2) Finetuning — finetuning (train) dataset
--model-files-dir "$TUT/image_classification/arkplus_fine_tuning/app_files" \
--query-file     "$TUT/image_classification/arkplus_fine_tuning/query.sql" \
--project-name "Ark+ Finetuning" --model-name "Ark+ Finetuning"

# 3) Multimodel evaluation — holdout dataset (evaluates pretrained + finetuned)
--model-files-dir "$TUT/image_evaluation/arkplus_multimodel_classification_evaluation/app_files" \
--query-file     "$TUT/image_evaluation/arkplus_multimodel_classification_evaluation/query.sql" \
--project-name "Ark+ Multimodel Eval" --model-name "Ark+ Multimodel Eval"
```

For (3), stage the finetuned checkpoint produced by (2) into the multimodel `app_files/` as
`arkplus_finetuned_weights.pt` (referenced by `models.arkplus_finetuned.checkpoint` in the
multimodel `config.json`, alongside the pretrained `arkplus_pretrained_weights.pt`). **Unwrap it
first:** the finetuning run's downloadable result is `FL_global_model.pt`, a *wrapped*
`OrderedDict({'model': <state_dict>, 'train_conf': …})`, but the evaluation job loads a **bare**
state dict — extract the inner `state_dict` and re-save:

```python
import torch
# weights_only=True: FL_global_model.pt is only tensors + a plain config dict, so load it safely
# (avoids unpickling arbitrary objects).
ck = torch.load("FL_global_model.pt", map_location="cpu", weights_only=True)   # from the finetune results zip
torch.save(ck["model"], "arkplus_finetuned_weights.pt")                        # 333-tensor bare state_dict; omni_heads.0 = (5, 1376)
```

The keys must match the eval model (`arkplus_singlehead`, `NUM_CLASSES_LIST: [5]`); a wrapped dict or
a head-shape mismatch makes the server persistor load fail and the model go straight to `ERROR`.

Results (cross-site metrics) are on the model's page in the UI, or via
`GET /api/model/<model_id>/metrics`.

---

## Troubleshooting (issues hit while validating this on staging)

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Bind for 0.0.0.0:80xx failed: port is already allocated` on 2nd trust | Both kits publish the same API ports | Give KCH distinct `IMAGING_API_PORT`/`DATA_ACCESS_API_PORT`/`TRUST_API_PORT` |
| `alloy` mount error `.../config.alloy … not a directory` | Prod compose defaults `OBSERVABILITY_CONFIG_DIR` to the EC2 path | Set `OBSERVABILITY_CONFIG_DIR=<repo>/trust/observability` in the kit |
| `xnat-reset … sudo: a terminal is required` | XNAT reset `rm -rf`s root-owned dirs | Run `up-trust` in a real terminal, or enable passwordless sudo |
| Create project → `500 Internal server error during authentication` | Token from the wrong Cognito pool (dev vs stag) | Force the stag `AWS_COGNITO_*` on the command line (Part C) |
| Auth returns an MFA challenge (`SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA`) | Cognito user has TOTP enrolled | Disable the stag admin user's MFA (stag only; prod keeps MFA) |
| `Unknown job_type: evaluation` | Base app / manifest not present in the hub's local `FL_APP_BASE_DIR` template tree (FLIP#724 — templates ship in the flip-api image, no S3 sync) | Ensure the flip-api image carries the target `fl-apps/` revision (rebuild + redeploy for a template change); in dev the `../fl-apps` bind-mount covers it |
| Model → `ERROR`, `Server disconnected without sending a response` | fl-api/fl-server OOM loading the 759 MiB checkpoint | Size `fl-api-net-1` ≥ 4 GiB, `fl-server-net-1` ≥ 8 GiB (`ecs_tasks.tf`) |
| **Finetuning** model → `ERROR` right after `init_training` (never reaches a `train` task); fl-server log shows `RuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for ArkPlusNVFlareWrapper: size mismatch for ark_model.omni_heads.0.weight: copying a param with shape torch.Size([14, 1376]) … current model is torch.Size([5, 1376])` | The `SERVER_CHECKPOINT` staged for finetuning is **not backbone-only** — it still carries the foundation model's 14-class `omni_heads.*`. The server persistor loads it `strict=False`, which tolerates *missing/unexpected* keys but **not a shape mismatch on a shared key**, so the 14-class head can't seat in the fresh 5-class model. Typically caused by pointing `pretrained_weights.pt` at the **eval** checkpoint (which keeps the heads) instead of the finetuning one. | Use a **backbone-only** `pretrained_weights.pt` — produce it via the finetuning tutorial's `make prepare-checkpoint` (`process_tools/preprocess_checkpoints.py`, which strips `omni_heads.*`). Quick fix if you only have a head-carrying copy: `torch.load` it and re-save `{k:v for k,v in sd.items() if not k.startswith("omni_heads.")}`. See the finetuning-checkpoint note under **The three experiments**. |
| Eval reports `RESULTS_UPLOADED` but **metrics are empty**; fl-client log shows `RuntimeError: No DICOM image/label pairs found`, and imaging-api logs `Trust-side storage error … [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/data/images/net-1/…-scans-ALL.zip'` | The eval-time per-accession DICOM download writes into the shared bind mount `trust/data/<KIT>` → `/app/data/images` (host uid 1001), but its `net-1/` subdir was created by the **root** fl-client, so imaging-api (uid 1000) can't write DICOMs into it. `get_dataframe`/`project_id` are fine — only the image write fails, so every accession is skipped and the datalist is empty. | Make the per-net dir writable by imaging-api's uid on each trust (container-root = host-root on the bind mount, so no host `sudo`): `docker exec -u 0 <trust>-imaging-api-1 chown -R 1000:1000 /app/data/images/net-1`. Durable — `CleanupImages` only clears the dir's *contents*, never re-creates it. |
| **Finetuning** (`standard`) model OOMs during **post-training cross-site validation** — all `train`/aggregation rounds finished (metrics reach the last local epoch), then fl-server `MemoryUtilized` spikes to the 8 GiB task ceiling and the job child process exits; the model **orphans at `TRAINING_STARTED`** (crash lands before `END_RUN`, so `PersistToS3AndCleanup` never runs → empty S3 results, net stays `BUSY`). Prod-only — staging (both trusts on one fast-local desktop) doesn't hit it. | The stock `CrossSiteModelEval` runs a `submit_model` all-to-all (each client's full model collected server-side **plus** the global model broadcast), and over a **slow-link trust** (e.g. BDMS/Thailand) the full ~759 MiB copies stay resident for minutes → OOM (~97 % of 8 GiB). | Finetune eval now defaults to **`GlobalModelEval`** (broadcasts only the aggregated global model; no `submit_model` matrix) — peak memory drops to ~75 % and the run completes to `RESULTS_UPLOADED`. To clear an already-orphaned model + free the net: `POST /fl/stop/{model_id}`. Head-only eval broadcast (only the trained head crosses the wire) is a further optimisation. |

## Results — baseline evaluation (validated on staging, 2026-07-03)

Pretrained Ark+ checkpoint scored against each trust's **holdout** cohort
(GSTT/Trust_1 n=478, KCH/Trust_2 n=468). Read from
`evaluation_results/evaluation_results.json` in the downloaded results zip.

> **Shape change (FLIP#754).** Runs from that fix onwards nest the metrics one level deeper —
> `{"<trust>": {"SRV_<model_name>": {...}}}` rather than `{"<trust>": {...}}`. Keying on the trust
> alone made each evaluated model overwrite the previous one, so a multimodel evaluation only ever
> reported its last model. The zip also carries `evaluation_results/evaluation_failures.json`, and a
> run whose every `validate` task fails now ends in `ERROR` instead of `RESULTS_UPLOADED`. The table
> below predates the change and is single-model, so its numbers are unaffected.

| Lesion | GSTT (Trust_1) AUROC | KCH (Trust_2) AUROC |
|---|---|---|
| Effusion | 0.998 | 1.000 |
| Consolidation | 0.989 | 0.998 |
| Infiltration | 0.863 | 0.878 |
| Lung Nodule or Mass | 0.970 | 0.955 |
| Pneumothorax | 0.971 | 0.997 |
| **Mean** | **0.958** | **0.966** |

`project_id`, cohort decryption and `flip.get_dataframe` all work on the platform — the
per-site datalist is fetched from the trust APIs and the DICOMs are pulled on demand at eval
time (see the permission-denied troubleshooting row above, which was the one real blocker).

> **Results zip no longer bundles the evaluated model.** `CrossSiteModelEval` writes the
> server-loaded checkpoint to `cross_site_val/model_shareables/SRV_<name>` (~759 MiB for the
> Ark+ baseline) purely to broadcast it to clients for scoring — it is an *input* the user
> already uploaded, not an eval output. `PersistToS3AndCleanup` (flip-utils) now prunes that
> directory before zipping. Verified on stag (fl-server image `62f0fb1e`): the same baseline-eval
> results zip dropped from **737 MiB to ~10 KB**, with the metrics
> (`evaluation_results/evaluation_results.json`) and the small per-site raw shareables
> (`cross_site_val/result_shareables/`) retained and the model gone.

## Results — finetuning (validated on staging, 2026-07-04)

Frozen-backbone finetune of the pretrained Ark+ checkpoint onto a fresh 5-class DeCaf head
(`AGGREGATE_ONLY_REGEX: "omni_heads"`, `LOAD_BACKBONE_ONLY: true`), on the **finetuning** (train)
cohort. This validation run used a reduced `GLOBAL_ROUNDS: 5` (× `LOCAL_ROUNDS: 2`) — see the
capacity note above for the full-scale default (50 global rounds) and why it takes several hours.

Training completed cleanly to `RESULTS_UPLOADED` on the deployed image (`acfbd280`, model
`7d179939`). Previously this OOM-crashed the fl-server mid-round-3 (unbounded per-round RSS
growth from re-broadcasting the ~759 MiB backbone every round). Two platform fixes made this run
possible, exercised together for the first time here:

- **Memory (Level 1).** FLIP's `ScatterAndGather` controller is now a thin subclass of NVFLARE's
  stock controller, inheriting `memory_gc_rounds` allocator-aware cleanup (`gc.collect` + glibc
  `malloc_trim`) — bounding server RSS across rounds instead of leaking ~1.3 GiB/round.
- **Broadcast (Level 2).** After round 0 the frozen backbone doesn't change, so it isn't
  re-broadcast. The fl-server log confirms this on every round after the first:
  `TrimBroadcastVars: broadcasting 2 of 333 var(s) matching 'omni_heads' at round N` — the 759 MiB
  backbone went out once, not five times; clients reconstructed the full model locally from it and
  trained normally.

There's no cross-site metric from training itself (no held-out split is scored during `standard`
training) — the finetuned checkpoint is scored downstream in the multimodel evaluation below,
which is what actually demonstrates the finetune improved the model.

> **Reproduced on production (GSTT + BDMS), 2026-07-07.** On prod the finetune's post-training
> cross-site validation surfaced a **third** memory issue not seen on staging: broadcasting the full
> ~759 MiB model to the clients OOM-crashed the fl-server (the slow BDMS/Thailand link kept the
> full-model copies resident for minutes, pushing `MemoryUtilized` to ~97 % of the 8 GiB task).
> Because the crash landed *before* NVFLARE's `END_RUN`, results never persisted and the model
> orphaned at `TRAINING_STARTED` (net wedged `BUSY`). Fixed by switching finetune eval to
> **`GlobalModelEval`** (only the aggregated global model is broadcast; the `submit_model` all-to-all
> is dropped) — peak memory fell to ~75 % and the run completed cleanly. See the cross-site-val OOM
> row in Troubleshooting.

## Results — multimodel evaluation: finetuned vs. pretrained (validated on staging, 2026-07-04)

Evaluates the pretrained Ark+ checkpoint **and** the finetuned checkpoint from the run above,
head-to-head, against the same **holdout** cohort used for the baseline evaluation above (reusing
that project — `model_id ed2d49b5`, image `acfbd280`). The finetune is at least as good on every
lesion at both trusts, and the gain survives Benjamini-Hochberg correction on 6 of the 10
lesion–trust pairings; the exceptions are the four where the pretrained model already sits at or
above 0.997, which leaves it no headroom. Significance is a two-sided DeLong test, BH-corrected per
trust (critical *p* = 2.7×10⁻² at GSTT, 7.2×10⁻⁷ at KCH). The figures below are the 50-round
production finetune — the staging run above used a shorter 5-round one and is not tabulated
separately.

**GSTT (Trust_1, n=478)**

| Lesion | Pretrained AUROC | Finetuned AUROC | Δ | DeLong *p* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Effusion | 0.998 | 1.000 | +0.002 | 0.12 (n.s.) |
| Consolidation | 0.989 | 0.997 | +0.008 | 0.027 |
| Infiltration | 0.863 | 0.998 | +0.135 | 1.8×10⁻¹⁴ |
| Lung Nodule or Mass | 0.970 | 1.000 | +0.030 | 5.9×10⁻⁶ |
| Pneumothorax | 0.971 | 1.000 | +0.029 | 0.0065 |
| **Mean** | **0.958** | **0.999** | **+0.041** | |

**KCH (Trust_2, n=468)**

| Lesion | Pretrained AUROC | Finetuned AUROC | Δ | DeLong *p* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Effusion | 1.000 | 1.000 | +0.000 | 1.00 (n.s.) |
| Consolidation | 0.998 | 1.000 | +0.002 | 0.31 (n.s.) |
| Infiltration | 0.878 | 1.000 | +0.122 | 1.2×10⁻¹⁵ |
| Lung Nodule or Mass | 0.955 | 1.000 | +0.045 | 7.2×10⁻⁷ |
| Pneumothorax | 0.997 | 1.000 | +0.003 | 0.19 (n.s.) |
| **Mean** | **0.966** | **1.000** | **+0.034** | |

The biggest single gain is Infiltration (0.863 → 0.998 at GSTT, 0.878 → 1.000 at KCH) — the weakest
pretrained score at both trusts in the baseline evaluation above. The finetuned model saturates both
cohorts (AUROC ≥ 0.997), so these numbers speak to the platform working end to end, not to a
state-of-the-art result on a synthetic task. Results zip was ~12 KB
(`evaluation_results/evaluation_results.json` only — the same results-zip prune from the baseline
evaluation applies here too).
