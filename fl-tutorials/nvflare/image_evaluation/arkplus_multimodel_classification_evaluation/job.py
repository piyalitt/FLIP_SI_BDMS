"""Client-API evaluation job definition for the Ark+ multimodel chest X-ray evaluation with FLIP.

This module defines the federated evaluation job using :class:`FlipEvalRecipe`. It supports two
execution modes:

*Export* (``--export --export-dir <path>``):
    Writes the complete NVFLARE job to ``<path>/flip_evaluation/``, including ``meta.json`` (carrying
    ``custom_props.model_id`` for lazy resolution), ``app/config/`` (server + client configs), and
    ``app/custom/`` (the bundled ``flip/`` package plus the staged user app files, including the
    ``arkplus_pretrained_weights.pt`` / ``arkplus_finetuned_weights.pt`` checkpoints the server-side
    locator loads). This is the primary, fully-local-verifiable path — no GPU or data required.

*SimEnv* (default, no flags):
    Runs a local simulation under the NVFLARE simulator. Requires a GPU, the DECAF chest X-ray dataset,
    and both processed checkpoints (``make prepare-checkpoint``). FLIP-specific values are injected via
    environment variables (``FLIP_PROJECT_ID``, ``FLIP_QUERY``). Per-site data is selected inside the
    evaluator via ``flare.get_site_name()`` (see ``app_files/data_utils.py``).

The checkpoints stay server-side in both modes — ``EvaluationModelLocator`` loads them on the server and
``GlobalModelEval`` broadcasts each one as its own named ``validate`` task; the evaluator scores the
broadcast weights and caches scores across tasks for the DeLong comparison (see
``app_files/evaluator.py``). This matches the production platform, where the FL API de-bundles the
``.pt`` files onto the hub staging volume and clients never receive them. Both modes go through NVFLARE's
:meth:`Recipe.execute`, which consumes ``--export``/``--export-dir`` from ``sys.argv`` itself (it strips
them before this script's own ``argparse`` runs) and exports-or-runs accordingly — so there is no
separate ``--export`` branch here.

Usage:
    # Export job config for review (no GPU needed)
    python job.py --export --export-dir ./fl_job --n_clients 2

    # SimEnv local simulation (requires GPU + data + both checkpoints)
    python job.py --n_clients 2

    """Bundle ``app_files/`` into the job — code + config to every site, ``.pt`` checkpoints for the server.

    The recipe wires only the NVFLARE components; the user-supplied app files (``evaluator.py``,
    ``models.py``, ``config.json``, the Ark+ model code) must be added to the job explicitly so they land
    in every site's ``app/custom/``. ``FedJob.add_file_to_{server,clients}`` registers them with the
    job's file sources, so they are bundled for **both** the SimEnv/simulator run (``recipe.execute``)
    and ``--export``. The checkpoints are registered for the **server only** — only the server-side
    ``EvaluationModelLocator`` reads them, broadcasting each as a named ``validate`` task that the
    evaluator scores. (NVFLARE's combined single-app layout still materialises one shared ``custom/``
    dir, so the files are physically present at every simulator site — harmless, nothing client-side
    opens them. On the production platform the FL API keeps them out of the job entirely and stages
    them on the hub volume.)
