# Multi-model Ark+ Chest X-ray Evaluation (NVFLARE Client API) — FLIP tutorial

FLIP tutorial for federated evaluation of **multiple** Ark+ models (a zero-shot foundation model and a
fine-tuned model) on chest X-ray classification, using the **NVFLARE Client API**. The same hold-out data
at each site is scored against every model, and per-lesion AUROC plus pairwise **DeLong** statistical
comparisons between the models are reported.

This tutorial replaces the previous executor-based implementation (`class FLIP_EVALUATOR(Executor)` +
the bespoke `ModelEval`/`EvaluationPTModelLocator` server flow, where **all** checkpoints arrived
unwrapped from a single `DataKind.COLLECTION` DXO), which is now deprecated. Here `evaluator.py` is a
plain `nvflare.client` script (`flare.init/receive/send`) and the job is a Python `FlipEvalRecipe` driven
by `job.py` rather than a job-type template + Docker harness.

The checkpoints stay **server-side**: `EvaluationModelLocator` loads every entry of
`config.json['models']` on the server and `GlobalModelEval` broadcasts each one as its own `validate`
task, named in the broadcast's DXO meta (`flip_eval_model_name`). The evaluator scores each broadcast on
the shared local cohort, caches the per-sample scores across tasks, and replies with the metrics of every
model scored so far — so the reply to the final task carries all per-model AUROCs plus the pairwise
DeLong map, which is what the server's last-reply-wins `EvaluationJsonGenerator` writes out. The
`evaluation_results.json` output contract (per-site, per-model metrics + DeLong) is unchanged from the
legacy tutorial.

> **Scope.** The same code path runs on the **local NVFLARE simulator / `uv` workflow** (`make run`,
> where `job.py` bundles the `.pt` files for the server-side locator) and on the **production FL
> platform** (where the FL API de-bundles uploaded checkpoints onto the hub staging volume — nothing
> client-side ever opens a `.pt` file in either mode). The FL server must run a `flip` package recent
> enough to name its evaluation broadcasts (`EvaluationModelLocator` stamping `flip_eval_model_name`);
> the evaluator fails with that remedy if the meta is absent.

## Compatible job type

This tutorial is designed for `JOB_TYPE=evaluation`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- A GPU (the Ark+ Swin-Large models run at 768×768) for a SimEnv run — both models are held on the
  device together, so this is more memory-hungry than the single-model baseline
- Access to the Ark+ foundation-model checkpoint (see checkpoint setup below); the fine-tuned checkpoint
  is downloaded automatically

## Dataset setup

This app expects a DECAF-formatted chest X-ray dataset with:

- A per-site CSV dataframe with `accession_id` and lesion labels
- Images organised under `<images_dir>/<accession_id>/...` (DICOM)

The quickest path uses the published reference dataset on Hugging Face. From the repo root:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials download-arkplus-eval-data   # fetch + lay out data/arkplus/site{1,2}_holdoff/
make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=arkplus_multimodel_classification_evaluation
```

`download-arkplus-eval-data` pulls the `site1_holdoff`/`site2_holdoff` hold-out splits of
[`aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-classification`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-classification)
and normalises them into `fl-tutorials/nvflare/data/arkplus/site{1,2}_holdoff/` (gitignored), matching
this tutorial's `.env.app` defaults (the same hold-out splits the baseline tutorial evaluates).

For local development, per-site paths are set in `.env.app`:

- `DEV_IMAGES_DIR` / `DEV_DATAFRAME` (single-site dev default)
- `SITE1_IMAGES_DIR` / `SITE1_DATAFRAME`, `SITE2_IMAGES_DIR` / `SITE2_DATAFRAME`
  (per-site, for the 2-client simulation)

### Per-site data in the simulator

Unlike the previous executor-based implementation (whose testing harness Docker-mounted each site's data
into the containers), the Client-API SimEnv runs **in-process with no Docker
mounts**. Per-site data is therefore selected inside the evaluator: it calls `flare.get_site_name()`
(`site-1`/`site-2`) and `app_files/data_utils.py` resolves the matching `SITE{N}_IMAGES_DIR` /
`SITE{N}_DATAFRAME` from `.env.app` (falling back to the single `DEV_*` paths). So `site-1` and `site-2`
score **different** hold-out sets.

### Simulator vs. real deployment

The per-site local paths are **simulator-only**. On a real federated client the fl-client runs with
`LOCAL_DEV=false`, and the data layer ignores the local paths entirely: the cohort dataframe comes from
`FLIP().get_dataframe(project_id, query)` and DICOMs from `FLIP().get_by_accession_number(...)` (the
trust's data-access-api / imaging-api). `project_id`/`query` are supplied by the FL job config —
`project_id` via the evaluator's `--project_id {project_id}` arg (substituted by the FLIP-API) and
`query` via the top-level `query` key of `config_fed_client.json` (read by `evaluator.load_query()`). The
switch is keyed on `LOCAL_DEV` in `app_files/data_utils.py` (`_is_local_dev`).

The cohort query for a real deployment is [`query.sql`](query.sql) — it selects the **hold-out** chest
X-ray set (`procedure_source_value = 'Chest X-ray (holdout)'`) and returns the seven lesion-label columns
both models are scored against.

## Checkpoint setup

The app evaluates two models, so it needs two clean `.pt` checkpoints in `app_files/`: the foundation
model `arkplus_pretrained_weights.pt` and the fine-tuned model `arkplus_finetuned_weights.pt`. Both are
loaded by every client's evaluator. `make run`/`make export` prepare both automatically (they run
`prepare-checkpoint` first).

### Foundation model (arkplus_pretrained)

The zero-shot Ark+ checkpoint is produced from the raw Ark6 training output
(`Ark6_swinLarge768_ep50.pth.tar`) in two steps — identical to the
[baseline tutorial](../arkplus_baseline_classification_evaluation/README.md):

1. **Fetch the raw checkpoint** (once):

   ```bash
   make download-raw-checkpoint
   ```

   This downloads it to the path given by `RAW_CHECKPOINT` in `.env.app` (default
   `models/Ark6_swinLarge768_ep50.pth.tar`, an app-relative path). If you already have the file, point
   `RAW_CHECKPOINT` at it instead. Access is via [this form](https://forms.gle/qkoDGXNiKRPTDdCe8).

2. **Prepare it** — done automatically by `make run`/`make export`, or on demand with
   `make prepare-checkpoint`, which converts the raw checkpoint into the clean
   `arkplus_pretrained_weights.pt` (a no-op if it already exists). The conversion script lives at
   `process_tools/preprocess_checkpoints.py` — see [process_tools/README.md](process_tools/README.md) for
   the extraction and key-remapping details.

### Fine-tuned model (arkplus_finetuned)

The fine-tuned checkpoint is downloaded automatically from
[`aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-finetuned`](https://huggingface.co/aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-finetuned)
on Hugging Face by `make run`/`make export` if not already present — no manual steps required. To use
your own, set `FINETUNED_CHECKPOINT` in `.env.app` to a URL or a local (absolute) path.

## App configuration

Default local development settings are in `.env.app`:

- `JOB_TYPE=evaluation`
- `RAW_CHECKPOINT=models/Ark6_swinLarge768_ep50.pth.tar`
- `FINETUNED_CHECKPOINT=` (empty → download the default fine-tuned model from `aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-finetuned`)
- `DEV_IMAGES_DIR` / `DEV_DATAFRAME` and the per-site `SITE{1,2}_*` paths

Each model is defined in `app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py`, built by `app_files/models.py`
(`_build_arkplus_raw`), and registered in `config.json["models"]` (its `arkplus_config`, checkpoint file,
and head/label mapping). The mapping from a model's NIH-14 head outputs to the target DECAF lesions lives
in `app_files/data_utils.py` (`MAPPING_REGISTRY`).

`make export`/`make run` run `job.py` in the **flip-utils** environment with the `full` ML extra (the same
package set the `flare-fl-base` FL image installs) so a local run matches the deployed image.

## Run the tutorial

`job.py` drives the recipe in two modes.

```bash
make download-raw-checkpoint   # once: fetch the raw Ark6 foundation checkpoint into models/

# Export the complete NVFLARE job for review (no GPU needed)
make export                    # prepares both checkpoints, then writes ./fl_job/flip_evaluation/

# SimEnv local simulation (requires GPU + data + both checkpoints)
make run                       # prepares both checkpoints (if needed), then runs the simulator via `make sim`
```

The fine-tuned checkpoint is auto-downloaded from HuggingFace on the first prepare. To override either
source, set `RAW_CHECKPOINT` / `FINETUNED_CHECKPOINT` in `.env.app` (or pass on the CLI, e.g.
`make run FINETUNED_CHECKPOINT=/path/to/custom_finetuned.pt`).

Useful targets: `make prepare-checkpoint` (prepare both checkpoints only), `make clean` (removes `./fl_job`).

## Key files

- `app_files/evaluator.py`: the Client-API evaluation loop (score each named broadcast → per-lesion AUROC + DeLong).
- `app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py`: the `ArkSwinTransformer` model definition.
- `app_files/models.py`: model factory (`_build_arkplus_raw`, plus `get_model()` for the recipe's persistor).
- `app_files/metrics_utils.py`: AUROC and the DeLong pairwise test implementation.
- `app_files/data_utils.py`: data loading, DICOM parsing, label mappings, transforms, per-site resolution.
- `app_files/config.json`: per-model checkpoint/architecture mapping and evaluation settings.
- `job.py`: builds `FlipEvalRecipe`, stages the checkpoints into the server app, and runs export / SimEnv.

## Output metrics

The evaluator returns **aggregate** (cohort-level) metrics only — per-lesion AUROC per model plus pairwise
DeLong p-values and Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) FDR-adjusted q-values — collected by the server into
`evaluation_results.json` keyed by site then model:

### Fields

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `auroc_<Lesion>` | `float` | Area under the ROC curve for this lesion. Ranges `[0, 1]`; `NaN` if only one class is present in the ground truth. |
| `delong_p_values` | `dict[str, dict[str, float]]` | Pairwise DeLong p-values for each lesion, keyed first by lesion name then by the *other* model name. The diagonal (model vs. self) is hardcoded `1.0` as a sanity check; off-diagonal entries are the two-sided DeLong test. `NaN` if the lesion's cohort has only one class present, or if either class has fewer than 2 members (DeLong's variance estimate is inestimable with a single sample in either class). Only present when ≥ 2 models are configured. |
| `delong_q_values` | `dict[str, dict[str, float]]` | Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-adjusted q-values, same shape and diagonal convention as `delong_p_values`. Corrected **per model pair**, across that pair's lesion-level p-values — each pair is its own independent correction family, never pooled across multiple pairs. `NaN` wherever the corresponding `delong_p_values` entry is `NaN` (excluded from that pair's correction, not folded into the other lesions' ranks). Only present when ≥ 2 models are configured. |

Per-sample (row-level) predictions are deliberately **not** produced or exported: a per-patient list would
leak the exact evaluation cohort size and be linkable to individual patients. (The previous executor-based
implementation wrote per-sample CSVs to the run dir; this tutorial omits them and returns aggregate
metrics only.)

## Model code & `timm` compatibility

`app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py` adapts the `ArkSwinTransformer` from the original Ark+ repository
([jlianglab/Ark](https://github.com/jlianglab/Ark)), which pins **`timm==0.5.4`**. The model's `forward`
is kept identical to the upstream version (`forward_features` → projector → `omni_heads`).

There is a subtle cross-version gotcha. In **timm 0.5.4**, `SwinTransformer.forward_features` pooled
internally — it ended with `AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1)` and returned a per-image `(B, C)` vector — so the Ark
`forward` never needed to pool. In **modern timm (1.x)** that global average pool was **moved out** of
`forward_features` (into `forward_head`), and `forward_features` now returns the *unpooled* spatial map
`(B, H, W, C)` (a 24×24 grid for a 768px Swin).

This tutorial runs on modern timm, and the upstream `forward` bypasses `forward_head` (it uses its own
`omni_heads`). Without an explicit pool the heads emitted a **per-location** grid of outputs instead of one
prediction per image — producing mis-shaped predictions and making AUROC fail with
`ValueError: multi_class must be in ('ovo', 'ovr')`.

**Fix.** `forward` (and `generate_embeddings`) now apply an explicit global-average-pool over the spatial
dims right after `forward_features`, restoring the timm 0.5.4 behaviour and matching the Swin head's
default `global_pool='avg'`:

```python
x = self.forward_features(x)
x = self._global_pool(x)   # mean over spatial dims; no-op if already (B, C)
```

**Verified equivalent.** Holding the backbone fixed, the explicit pool was compared against an exact
replica of timm 0.5.4's `AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1)` pooling: the pooled features and all head outputs were
**bit-for-bit identical** (`max |Δ| = 0.0`), since averaging over the flattened token sequence (`L`) equals
averaging over the `H×W` grid (`L = H×W`). The fix is also a no-op if a future `timm` returns an
already-pooled `(B, C)` tensor.

## Notes and troubleshooting

- DeLong p-values below machine epsilon are reported as `0.0`. The test is two-sided (H₀: AUC_a = AUC_b).
- `delong_p_values` is only emitted when at least 2 models are configured in `config.json["models"]`.
- `delong_q_values` applies Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction independently per model pair, across that
  pair's lesion-level DeLong p-values (5 tests per pair in this tutorial's config). If a third model is
  ever added, each new pair gets its own independent correction — q-values are never pooled across pairs.
- A lesion with a `NaN` p-value (either the cohort has only one class, or either class has fewer than 2
  members) is excluded from its pair's BH correction and reported as `NaN` in `delong_q_values`, not
  folded into the other lesions' ranks.
- **Interpreting `delong_q_values`**: a q-value is not a rescaled or "corrected" version of that same
  lesion's raw p-value — it is the smallest false-discovery-rate level at which this specific lesion's
  comparison would be called significant, considering it jointly with the rest of its pair's lesion
  tests. Concretely, `q <= 0.05` means "this finding survives if we're willing to accept a 5% false
  discovery rate across this pair's lesion comparisons" — not "there's a 5% chance of this AUROC gap
  under the null" (that's what the raw p-value alone would mean, without accounting for having run
  multiple simultaneous lesion tests). A q-value can therefore differ substantially from its own raw
  p-value (it's always `>= p`, and several lesions can share an identical q-value even with different
  raw p-values) — comparing `q` against your chosen significance level is the correct way to decide
  which lesions "survived" correction, not comparing the raw `delong_p_values` entries directly.
  **Why ties happen:** the step-up rule always rejects a contiguous prefix of the sorted ranks — if rank
  `k` crosses its own line `p_(k) <= (k/m)*Q`, every smaller rank `1..k-1` is swept into that same
  rejection *regardless of whether their own raw value would have crossed at that `Q`*. So rank `i`'s
  true q-value isn't "the `Q` at which `i` crosses its own line" — it's "the smallest `Q` at which *any*
  rank `j >= i` crosses its own line," i.e. `q_(i) = min` over `j >= i` of `p_(j) * m/j`, computed as a
  running minimum from the largest rank inward. Worked example with `m=3` sorted p-values `0.02, 0.025,
  0.03`: the per-rank raw values are `0.06, 0.0375, 0.03` (not ascending), but the running min from the
  back collapses all three to `q = 0.03` — rank 3's own crossing point is small enough to pull in ranks
  1 and 2 even though their individual raw values were larger. That's the mechanism, not a bug: a later,
  weaker-p lesion can still set the q-value for an earlier, stronger-p lesion in the same pair.
  You can also go the other direction, from a chosen FDR level back to a raw-p cutoff: pick a target
  `Q` for a given model pair, take every lesion in that pair with `q <= Q`, and the *largest* raw
  p-value among them is the critical cutoff for that `Q` — every `delong_p_values` entry at or below
  that cutoff is exactly the set that survives correction at `Q`. That's useful if you'd rather present
  a table of raw p-values (or the AUROC gap) and bold/flag whichever cells clear that single cutoff,
  stating `Q` and the derived cutoff together in the caption, instead of printing a `q` column.
- Both models are loaded onto the GPU together; if you hit an out-of-memory error, reduce `BATCH_SIZE` in
  `config.json` (it defaults to 1) or evaluate on a smaller GPU-fitting cohort.
