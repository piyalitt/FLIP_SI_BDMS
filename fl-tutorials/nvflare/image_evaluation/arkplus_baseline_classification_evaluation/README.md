# Baseline Ark+ Chest X-ray Evaluation (NVFLARE Client API) — FLIP tutorial

FLIP tutorial for federated evaluation of a single zero-shot Ark+ foundation model on chest X-ray
classification, using the **NVFLARE Client API**. The hold-out data at each site is scored against the
model and per-lesion AUROC is reported.

This tutorial replaces the previous executor-based implementation (`class FLIP_EVALUATOR(Executor)` +
the bespoke `ModelEval`/`EvaluationPTModelLocator` server flow, weights arriving unwrapped from a
`COLLECTION` DXO), which is now deprecated. Here, `evaluator.py` is a plain `nvflare.client` script
(`flare.init/receive/send`, weights arriving as `input_model.params`), and the server reuses the shared
`CrossSiteModelEval` validate path with a single-model `EvaluationModelLocator`; the job is a Python
`FlipEvalRecipe` driven by `job.py` rather than a job-type template + harness.

The recipe loads the uploaded checkpoint on the server and broadcasts it to every client as a single
`FLModel`; the client's `is_evaluate()` branch scores it on the local cohort and returns aggregate
per-lesion AUROC. The numerical pipeline (model, transforms, head inference, label mapping, AUROC) is
identical to the previous implementation's, so the reported metrics match — only the FL transport
differs. The `evaluation_results.json` output contract is unchanged.

## Compatible job type

This tutorial is designed for `JOB_TYPE=evaluation`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- A GPU (the Ark+ Swin-Large model runs at 768×768), plus the `flare-fl-base` image for a SimEnv run
- Access to the Ark+ foundation-model checkpoint (see checkpoint setup below)

## Dataset setup

This app expects a DECAF-formatted chest X-ray dataset with:

- A per-site CSV dataframe with `accession_id` and lesion labels
- Images organised under `<images_dir>/<accession_id>/...` (DICOM)

The quickest path uses the published reference dataset on Hugging Face. From the repo root:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials download-arkplus-eval-data   # fetch + lay out data/arkplus/site{1,2}_holdoff/
make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=arkplus_baseline_classification_evaluation
```

`download-arkplus-eval-data` pulls the `site1_holdoff`/`site2_holdoff` hold-out splits of
[`aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-classification`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-classification)
and normalises them into `fl-tutorials/nvflare/data/arkplus/site{1,2}_holdoff/` (gitignored), matching
this tutorial's `.env.app` defaults.

For local development, per-site paths are set in `.env.app`:

- `DEV_IMAGES_DIR` / `DEV_DATAFRAME` (single-site dev default)
- `SITE1_IMAGES_DIR` / `SITE1_DATAFRAME`, `SITE2_IMAGES_DIR` / `SITE2_DATAFRAME`
  (per-site, for the 2-client simulation)

### Per-site data in the simulator

Unlike the previous executor-based implementation (whose testing harness Docker-mounted each site's data
into the containers), the Client-API SimEnv runs **in-process with no Docker
mounts**. Per-site data is
therefore selected inside the evaluator: it calls `flare.get_site_name()` (`site-1`/`site-2`) and
`app_files/data_utils.py` resolves the matching `SITE{N}_IMAGES_DIR` / `SITE{N}_DATAFRAME` from `.env.app`
(falling back to the single `DEV_*` paths). So `site-1` and `site-2` score **different** hold-out sets.

### Simulator vs. real deployment

The per-site local paths are **simulator-only**. On a real federated client the fl-client runs with
`LOCAL_DEV=false`, and the data layer ignores the local paths entirely: the cohort dataframe comes from
`FLIP().get_dataframe(project_id, query)` and DICOMs from `FLIP().get_by_accession_number(...)` (the
trust's data-access-api / imaging-api). `project_id`/`query` are supplied by the FL job config — `project_id`
via the evaluator's `--project_id {project_id}` arg (substituted by the FLIP-API) and `query` via the
top-level `query` key of `config_fed_client.json` (read by `evaluator.load_query()`). The switch is keyed on
`LOCAL_DEV` in `app_files/data_utils.py` (`_is_local_dev`).

The cohort query for a real deployment is [`query.sql`](query.sql) — it selects the **hold-out** chest
X-ray set (`procedure_source_value = 'Chest X-ray (holdout)'`) and returns the seven lesion-label columns.
Pass it as the project's cohort query (e.g. `make e2e_smoke QUERY_FILE=.../arkplus_baseline_classification_evaluation/query.sql`).

## Checkpoint setup

The evaluation app needs the foundation-model checkpoint as a clean `.pt` file at
`app_files/arkplus_pretrained_weights.pt`. The **server** loads it (`EvaluationModelLocator`) and broadcasts
the weights to clients over the validate task — the clients never read the `.pt`. It is produced from the raw
Ark6 training output (`Ark6_swinLarge768_ep50.pth.tar`) in two steps:

1. **Fetch the raw checkpoint** (once):

   ```bash
   make download-raw-checkpoint
   ```

   This downloads `Ark6_swinLarge768_ep50.pth.tar` to the path given by `RAW_CHECKPOINT` in `.env.app`
   (default `models/Ark6_swinLarge768_ep50.pth.tar`, an app-relative path). If you already have the file,
   point `RAW_CHECKPOINT` at it instead. Access to the raw checkpoint is via
   [this form](https://forms.gle/qkoDGXNiKRPTDdCe8).

2. **Prepare (pre-process) it** — done automatically by `make run`/`make export`, or on demand:

   ```bash
   make prepare-checkpoint
   ```

   `prepare-checkpoint` is a no-op if `arkplus_pretrained_weights.pt` already exists; otherwise it converts
   the raw checkpoint into a clean state dict (runs in this tutorial's local `uv` env). The conversion script
   lives at `process_tools/preprocess_checkpoints.py` — see
   [process_tools/README.md](process_tools/README.md) for the extraction and key-remapping details.

## App configuration

Default local development settings are in `.env.app`:

- `JOB_TYPE=evaluation`
- `RAW_CHECKPOINT=models/Ark6_swinLarge768_ep50.pth.tar`
- `DEV_IMAGES_DIR` / `DEV_DATAFRAME` and the per-site `SITE{1,2}_*` paths
- `FLIP_PROJECT_ID` / `FLIP_QUERY` (injected into the recipe for SimEnv; ignored under `LOCAL_DEV`)

The model is defined in `app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py`, built by `app_files/models.py` (`get_model()`),
and registered in `config.json["models"]`. The mapping from the model's NIH-14 head outputs to the target
DECAF lesions lives in `app_files/data_utils.py` (`MAPPING_REGISTRY`).

`make export`/`make run` run `job.py` in the **flip-utils** environment with the `full` ML extra (the same
package set the `flare-fl-base` FL image installs) so a local run matches the deployed image.

## Run the tutorial

`job.py` drives the recipe in two modes.

```bash
make download-raw-checkpoint   # once: fetch the raw Ark6 checkpoint into models/

# Export the complete NVFLARE job for review or Docker deployment (no GPU needed)
make export                    # prepares the checkpoint, then writes ./fl_job/flip_evaluation/

# SimEnv local simulation (requires GPU + data + checkpoint)
make run                       # prepares the checkpoint (if needed), then runs the simulator via `make sim`
```

Useful targets: `make prepare-checkpoint` (convert the raw checkpoint only), `make clean` (removes `./fl_job`).

## Key files

- `app_files/evaluator.py`: the Client-API evaluation loop (receive model → score → send per-lesion AUROC).
- `app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py`: the `ArkSwinTransformer` model definition.
- `app_files/models.py`: model factory (`get_model()`).
- `app_files/metrics_utils.py`: AUROC and head→lesion label mapping.
- `app_files/data_utils.py`: data loading, DICOM parsing, label mappings, transforms, per-site resolution.
- `app_files/config.json`: model/checkpoint mapping and evaluation settings.
- `job.py`: builds `FlipEvalRecipe` and runs export / SimEnv.

## Output metrics

The evaluator returns **aggregate** (cohort-level) per-lesion AUROC only, collected by the server into
`evaluation_results.json` keyed by site then model:

```json
{
    "site-1": {
        "arkplus_pretrained": {
            "auroc_Effusion": 0.998,
            "auroc_Consolidation": 0.989,
            "auroc_Infiltration": 0.863,
            "auroc_Lung Nodule or Mass": 0.970,
            "auroc_Pneumothorax": 0.971
        }
    },
    "site-2": {
        "...": "..."
    }
}
```

(Values above are **real measured scores**, not a fabricated example: the pretrained checkpoint over one
hold-out cohort. Treat them as one cohort's result, not a target to reproduce.)

### Fields

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `auroc_<Lesion>` | `float` | Area under the ROC curve for this lesion. Ranges `[0, 1]`; `NaN` if only one class is present in the ground truth. |

Per-sample (row-level) predictions are deliberately **not** produced or exported: a per-patient list would
leak the exact evaluation cohort size and be linkable to individual patients. (The previous executor-based
implementation wrote per-sample CSVs to the run dir; this tutorial omits them.)

## Model code & `timm` compatibility

`app_files/arkplus_flat_models.py` adapts the `ArkSwinTransformer` from the original Ark+ repository
([jlianglab/Ark](https://github.com/jlianglab/Ark)), which pins **`timm==0.5.4`**. The model's `forward` is
intentionally kept identical to the upstream version:

```python
x = self.forward_features(x)
if self.projector:
    x = self.projector(x)
return x, self.omni_heads[head_n](x)
```

There is a subtle cross-version gotcha here. In **timm 0.5.4**, `SwinTransformer.forward_features` pooled
internally — it ended with `AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1)` and returned a per-image `(B, C)` vector — so the Ark
`forward` never needed to pool. In **modern timm (1.x)**, that global average pool was **moved out** of
`forward_features` (it now lives in `forward_head`), and `forward_features` returns the *unpooled* spatial
feature map `(B, H, W, C)` (a 24×24 grid for a 768px Swin).

This tutorial runs on modern timm, and the upstream `forward` bypasses `forward_head` (it uses its own
`omni_heads`). Without an explicit pool, the heads therefore emitted a **per-location** grid of outputs
instead of one prediction per image — which produced mis-shaped predictions and made AUROC fail with
`ValueError: multi_class must be in ('ovo', 'ovr')`.

**Fix.** `forward` (and `generate_embeddings`) now apply an explicit global-average-pool over the spatial
dims right after `forward_features`, restoring the timm 0.5.4 behaviour and matching the Swin head's
default `global_pool='avg'`:

```python
x = self.forward_features(x)
x = self._global_pool(x)   # mean over spatial dims; no-op if already (B, C)
```

**Verified equivalent.** Holding the backbone fixed, the explicit pool was compared against an exact
replica of timm 0.5.4's `AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1)` pooling. The pooled features and all head outputs were
**bit-for-bit identical** (`max |Δ| = 0.0`) — averaging over the flattened sequence of tokens (`L`) is the
same operation as averaging over the `H×W` grid (`L = H×W`). The fix is also shape-robust: it is a no-op
if a future `timm` returns an already-pooled `(B, C)` tensor.
