# FLIP Trust — Kubernetes Helm Chart

> **Deploys: trust only.** No Central Hub component is defined by this chart. The hub is still involved —
> the trust must be registered on it (`make register-trust KIT=<CODE>`) to get its kit file. See
> [`../README.md`](../README.md) for how this provider relates to the other two.

This Helm chart deploys the FLIP trust-side services on Kubernetes. It follows
the same **zero inbound trust** architecture as the Docker Compose deployment:
trust services only make outbound connections to the Central Hub and the FL
server; no inbound ports are exposed from the K8s cluster.

> **Deployment status.** The chart is validated on single-node k3s and includes
> kit synchronisation, default-deny ingress, audited egress rules, least-privilege
> service accounts, and stateless-workload hardening. Review the
> [known limitations](#known-limitations), particularly storage and Pod Security
> constraints, before selecting it for a production Trust.

## Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes cluster** 1.28+ (EKS, AKS, or on-prem)
- **Helm** 4.x (the CI-tested version; 3.16+ also works)
- **kubectl** configured with cluster access
- **NVIDIA GPU Operator** (if GPU workloads are enabled)
- **External Secrets Operator** or **Secrets Store CSI Driver** (recommended for
  production secrets management)

> **Helm 4 readiness semantics.** Helm 4 reimplemented `--wait` on top of
> [kstatus](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/tree/master/pkg/kstatus),
> which is stricter than Helm 3's readiness check — an install that Helm 3 called
> ready can now block until the workloads genuinely settle, and time out if they
> never do. `make deploy` does **not** pass `--wait` (it relies on `--timeout 20m`
> alone), so this only bites if you add `--wait` to your own `helm upgrade`
> invocation; if you do, size `--timeout` for the slowest service to become ready
> rather than for the API call to return.

## Quickstart

A K8s trust is registered with the hub **exactly like any other trust** — by a
CODE-named *kit*. Registration is done once, centrally, by the DB-backed
`register_trust` CLI (it mints the per-trust credentials and claims an FL kit
slot); the chart never registers anything itself. The flow is:

```
 hub side (once)            cluster side (this chart)
 ─────────────────          ─────────────────────────
 new-trust ─► register ─► sync-trust-kit ─► sync-kit ─► up ─► (add-k8s-trust)
            writes trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>   patches Secret + writes override
```

### 1. Register the trust on the hub (produces the kit)

```bash
# From the repo root. <CODE> is this trust's name, e.g. Trust_K8s.
make new-trust TRUST_CODE=<CODE> TRUST_NAME="<Human Name>"
make -C deploy/providers/AWS register-trusts KIT=<CODE> PROD=stag   # mints creds + claims FL slot
make sync-trust-kit KIT=<CODE> PROD=stag                            # fills the Hub-shared block
```

This writes `trust/.env.<CODE>.stag` containing the per-trust keys
(`TRUST_API_KEY`, `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY`) and the Hub-shared block
(`AES_KEY_BASE64`, `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL`, FL settings). The hub stores only the
SHA-256 hash of the API key — re-running registration is idempotent.

### 2. Provide the infrastructure secrets

The kit owns only the per-trust keys. The chart's *other* secrets (XNAT, OMOP,
Orthanc, Grafana, S3 kit-sync credentials) are deployment-specific — supply them
via the chart's built-in Secret template (`secrets.create=true` + a
`values-secrets.yaml`, see the [Secrets Reference](#secrets-reference)) or create
the Secret externally. `make sync-kit` (next step) patches the per-trust keys
*on top* of this Secret without touching the infra keys.

### 3. Sync the kit into the cluster

```bash
make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes sync-kit KIT=<CODE> PROD=stag
```

This reads `trust/.env.<CODE>.stag`, patches the per-trust keys
(`trust-api-key`, `trust-internal-service-key[-header]`, `aes-key-base64`) into
the chart's Kubernetes Secret (`trust-release-flip-trust-secrets`), and writes a
secret-free Helm override `k8s-trust-<CODE>.yaml` carrying the hub URL, FL
backend, AWS region, the fl-client kit bucket, and the slot-aware NVFLARE kit
path. Plaintext keys go straight into the Secret over kubectl's TLS channel —
never to disk.

### 4. Install / upgrade the chart

```bash
make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes deploy-trust-k8s KIT=<CODE> PROD=stag
```

This runs `helm upgrade --install` with the generated override and then
`patch-kit-secrets` (injects the per-trust keys into the Helm-owned Secret and
restarts the API deployments). Equivalent raw Helm for the install step:

```bash
helm upgrade --install trust-release ./deploy/providers/kubernetes/ \
  --namespace flip-trust --create-namespace \
  -f deploy/providers/kubernetes/values.yaml \
  -f deploy/providers/kubernetes/values-secrets.yaml \
  -f deploy/providers/kubernetes/k8s-trust-<CODE>.yaml
```

`sync-kit` stamps a newly created Secret with Helm ownership metadata so the
first install can adopt it. It also regenerates the FL-server egress port from
the kit on every run, so upgrades do not lose the fl-client gRPC allowance.

### 5. Verify the trust is polling

```bash
kubectl get pods -n flip-trust
kubectl logs -n flip-trust -l app.kubernetes.io/component=trust-api
# Expect: POST .../api/trust/heartbeat "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
#         GET  .../api/tasks/pending   "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
```

A `401 "API key is missing"` means the API-key **header** is mismatched — the
chart default `TRUST_API_KEY_HEADER` is `Authorization` (the platform default);
override it only if your hub uses a different header.

### 6. (FL training only) Open the FL-server NLB

Polling needs nothing more. For FL *training*, the K8s node's FL client must
reach the hub's FL server. Add the node's public/egress IP to
`K8S_TRUST_PUBLIC_IPS` in the hub env file (an HCL list, e.g.
`K8S_TRUST_PUBLIC_IPS=["1.2.3.4"]`), then reconcile the NLB:

```bash
make -C deploy/providers/AWS add-k8s-trust K8S_TRUST_IP=<node-public-ip> PROD=stag
```

This is a normal `terraform apply` (no `-target`), so re-running with an
already-listed IP is a no-op (idempotent — #596).

| `secrets.data.*` | `""` | Secret key-value pairs (base64 encoded) |

### Service-Specific Settings

Each service has a configuration block with the following common structure:

```yaml
serviceName:
  enabled: true               # Deploy this service
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/...   # Container image repository
    tag: stag                 # Image tag
    pullPolicy: Always        # Image pull policy
  replicas: 1                 # Number of pod replicas
  service:
    port: 8000                # Service port
    type: ClusterIP           # Service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "512Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
```

Available services:

| Service Block | Description | Stateful? |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `trustApi` | API gateway, polls Central Hub | No |
| `imagingApi` | DICOM image retrieval | No |
| `dataAccessApi` | OMOP database queries | No |
| `flClient` | FL participant | No |
| `omopDb` | OMOP PostgreSQL database | Yes |
| `orthanc` | DICOM PACS server | Yes |
| `xnat.web` | XNAT Tomcat web application | Yes |
| `xnat.db` | XNAT PostgreSQL database | Yes |
| `xnat.nginx` | XNAT reverse proxy | No |
| `observability.loki` | Log aggregation | Yes |
| `observability.alloy` | Log collection agent | No (DaemonSet) |
| `observability.grafana` | Metrics dashboard | Yes |

### External Service Override

Stateful services (`omopDb`, `orthanc`, `xnat`) support external overrides:

```yaml
omopDb:
  enabled: false
  external:
    host: "my-rds-instance.cluster-xxx.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com"
    port: 5432
```

When `enabled: false`, the chart creates an `ExternalName` Service pointing to
the external host instead of deploying the service itself.

### OMOP core vocabulary

The `omop-db` image and the pgdata archive restored by `omopDb.initJob` are both
**vocab-free** (FLIP#842/843). The licensed core vocabulary — SNOMED CT, LOINC,
Read v2, dm+d — is streamed in afterwards by the `omop-vocab-load`
post-install/post-upgrade hook.

That bundle cannot be publicly mirrored, so unlike `initJob` there is **no
anonymous fallback**. The hook runs only when `omopDb.vocabLoad.s3Bucket` names
a bucket the cluster can read; the chart default is empty, so a default install
succeeds with **no vocabulary loaded** (`helm install` prints a warning).

> **Cohort queries that join `omop.concept` return nothing until the vocabulary
> is loaded.** The stack passes every health check in this state — the only
> symptom is empty cohorts.

Two ways to load it:

| You have… | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| Org S3 access | `make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes sync-kit KIT=<CODE> PROD=<env>` writes `omopDb.vocabLoad.s3Bucket` from the kit's `AICENTRE_BUCKET_NAME`, then `make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes deploy-trust-k8s KIT=<CODE>`. **Check the kit carries your own environment's bucket** — it is not a hub-managed key, so a kit scaffolded from `trust/.env.example` ships the dev one, and trust roles have no cross-account read. |
| Your own licences | Build an equivalent bundle from [OHDSI Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/) / [NHS TRUD](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/) (see `trust/omop-db/README.md`), put it in a bucket you control, and set `omopDb.vocabLoad.s3Bucket` / `bundleName`. Or run `trust/omop-db/files/load_core_vocab.sh` against the database directly. |

Run both targets with `-C deploy/providers/kubernetes` (or from that directory):
the repo-root `make sync-kit` does not exist, and the root `deploy-trust-k8s`
forwards to the chart's plain `deploy` target, so `KIT=` never reaches the
per-trust override file.

AWS credentials for the fetch are shared with the init job:
`omopDb.initJob.awsProfile` and `omopDb.initJob.hostAwsMount` (enable the host
`~/.aws` mount for local clusters; use IRSA on EKS). Note `awsProfile` only
reaches this Job when `hostAwsMount` is enabled.

The hook probes before it fetches: `probe-vocab` asks the database what is
missing, and only if something is does `fetch-bundle` download the bundle. This
matters because the hook is on the critical path of *every* `helm upgrade` and a
failed hook fails the whole release — so an upgrade that changes an unrelated
image tag costs two queries per vocabulary table (the probe's guards, then the
loader's) plus a pass over the constraint catalogue, not a multi-GB download. The
download lands in an `emptyDir` sized by `omopDb.vocabLoad.workDirSize` (10Gi,
enough for the zip and its unpacked contents together); lower it, and the
matching `fetchResources` / `loadResources` requests, for a cluster with small
nodes. Keep the container `ephemeral-storage` limits above `workDirSize` too:
emptyDir usage is charged to the pod, whose ceiling is the regular containers'
limits summed with each init container's taken as a max against that total — so
here it is 12Gi, not 3 × 12Gi. Limits below the work dir size would evict the pod
before it had finished filling it.

An external OMOP database (`omopDb.enabled: false`) already skips this Job. Set
`omopDb.vocabLoad.enabled: false` only to keep an in-cluster `omop-db` while
loading the vocabulary by hand.

### FL Backend Configuration

Switch between NVFLARE and Flower:

```bash
# NVFLARE (default)
helm install trust-release ./ --set flBackend=nvflare

# Flower
helm install trust-release ./ --set flBackend=flower
```

#### Staged participant kit (no S3)

By default the `kit-init` initContainer fetches the active backend's participant kit
from S3 into an `emptyDir`. Air-gapped trusts and local `kind` clusters can stage the
kit on the node instead:

```yaml
flClient:
  <backend>:            # nvflare or flower — the active backend's flag
    kitFromS3:
      enabled: false
  kitHostPath: /opt/fl-kit/<slot>   # node directory holding the kit
```

The `fl-client-kit` volume then mounts `kitHostPath` directly and no `kit-init` runs.
The directory must be readable by the FL image's runtime user (uid 1000 for the
NVFLARE client, uid 49999 for the Flower SuperNode). With `kitFromS3` disabled and
`kitHostPath` unset, the kit volume renders as an empty `emptyDir` — nothing fails at
deploy time and the client starts without credentials, so configure one or the other.
When `kitFromS3` is enabled it wins over a set `kitHostPath`.

### GPU Configuration

```yaml
flClient:
  gpu:
    enabled: true
    count: 1
```

Requires the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) to be
installed in the cluster.

### Autoscaling

```yaml
autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
  targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80
```

### Pod Disruption Budget

```yaml
podDisruptionBudget:
  enabled: true
  minAvailable: 1
```

### Network Policies

Network policies are enabled by default and implement the zero-inbound-trust
model:

- Deny all ingress from outside the namespace
- Allow all intra-namespace communication
- Allow egress to DNS (port 53), HTTPS (port 443), AWS IMDS (169.254.169.254)
- Allow custom egress CIDRs via `networkPolicies.allowedEgressCIDRs`

```yaml
networkPolicies:
  enabled: true
  allowedEgressCIDRs:
    - "10.0.0.0/8"
    - "172.16.0.0/12"
```

For the full audit of what egress is allowed and why, the residual risk (notably
443-to-anywhere), and a hardening guide, see
[NETWORK-POLICY.md](NETWORK-POLICY.md).

## Secrets Reference

The following keys must be present in the Secret (either created by the chart
with `secrets.create=true` or pre-created externally):

| Secret Key | Used By | Description |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `aes-key-base64` | trust-api, imaging-api, data-access-api | AES-256 encryption key (base64) |
| `trust-api-key` | trust-api | API key for hub authentication |
| `trust-internal-service-key-header` | trust-api, imaging-api, data-access-api | Header name for trust-internal auth |
| `trust-internal-service-key` | trust-api, imaging-api, data-access-api | Secret key for trust-internal auth |
| `omop-postgres-password` | omop-db | PostgreSQL password |
| `data-access-postgres-password` | data-access-api | Data reader DB password |
| `orthanc-registered-users` | orthanc | Orthanc registered users, JSON user map e.g. `{"admin": "<password>"}`. Required when `orthanc.enabled` — the env ref is non-optional (asserted on every chart render by the `Helm Template` CI job) and the image refuses to start without users (FLIP-PT-091). Populated from the `ORTHANC_REGISTERED_USERS` env var by `scripts/generate_values.py` |
| `xnat-admin-password` | xnat-web | XNAT admin password |
| `xnat-service-user` | xnat-web, imaging-api | XNAT service account username |
| `xnat-service-password` | xnat-web, imaging-api | XNAT service account password |
| `xnat-datasource-password` | xnat-web, xnat-db, imaging-api | Password of the `xnat` **application role** — mint via `make generate-xnat-credentials KIT=<CODE>` and fill from the kit with `scripts/generate_values.py`; xnat-web and xnat-db refuse to start on the shipped placeholder or weak values, and imaging-api splices it into its `XNAT_DATABASE_URL` (FLIP-PT-056) |
| `xnat-datasource-admin-password` | xnat-db | Password of the Postgres **superuser** (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`). Minted by the same command, from the kit's `XNAT_DATASOURCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Must differ from `xnat-datasource-password` — xnat-db's entrypoint refuses to start when the two match (FLIP-PT-056) |
| `grafana-admin-password` | grafana | Grafana admin password |
| `s3-access-key-id` | fl-client (init container) | AWS access key for S3 kit sync |
| `s3-secret-access-key` | fl-client (init container) | AWS secret key for S3 kit sync |

For production, use [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/) to
sync secrets from AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.

### xnat-db roles and credential rotation

xnat-db runs two Postgres roles, mirroring the swarm deployment: the `postgres`
superuser (`xnat-datasource-admin-password`) and the non-superuser `xnat`
application role (`xnat-datasource-password`) that xnat-web, imaging-api and the
imaging-import worker authenticate with. The `xnat` role is created by the
image's baked `XNAT.sql`, which runs from `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

> **Do not mount a ConfigMap over `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.** A directory
> mount replaces the directory, hiding `XNAT.sql`, and the two roles silently
> collapse into one. Per-file mounts need an explicit `subPath`.

**Both passwords apply only at the first initdb of an empty PVC.** A StatefulSet
PVC survives `helm upgrade` and `helm uninstall`, so changing either secret
afterwards leaves the database on the old credential while the pods start using
the new one, and authentication fails. To rotate on a live install, update the
database to match the secret:

```bash
kubectl exec -it <xnat-db-pod> -- \
  psql -U postgres -c "ALTER ROLE xnat WITH PASSWORD '<xnat-datasource-password>'"
kubectl exec -it <xnat-db-pod> -- \
  psql -U postgres -c "ALTER ROLE postgres WITH PASSWORD '<xnat-datasource-admin-password>'"
```

**Upgrading an install created before the roles were split:** those deployments
set `POSTGRES_USER=xnat`, so their single role is a superuser named `xnat` and
there is no `postgres` role to authenticate as. Either re-initialise the xnat-db
PVC (destroys the XNAT database — export anything you need first), or keep the
old install on the previous chart version.

### Security Model

- **NetworkPolicies**: Default-deny-ingress, allow-intra-namespace, allow-egress
  to Central Hub and FL server only (audit and threat model: [NETWORK-POLICY.md](NETWORK-POLICY.md))
- **No LoadBalancer or NodePort** for application services (all ClusterIP)
- **Secrets**: Separate from ConfigMaps; recommend External Secrets Operator
- **FL clients**: No Central Hub credentials; connect outbound to FL server only
- **ServiceAccounts**: each stateless service runs under its own ServiceAccount
  with no RBAC role bindings (none of the pods call the Kubernetes API — least
  privilege by default).
- **Pod Security & container hardening**: the chart-created namespace
  carries Pod Security Standards labels (`enforce=baseline`, `warn`/`audit=restricted`
  by default — tune via `podSecurity.*`), and the stateless services
  (trust-api, imaging-api, data-access-api, fl-client)
  apply a container `securityContext` (`allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, drop
  `ALL` capabilities, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`) from `.Values.securityContext`.
  `runAsNonRoot` / `readOnlyRootFilesystem` are left opt-in (image-dependent).
  **Remaining for full `restricted` enforcement:** the stateful images
  (`xnat-web`, `xnat-db`, `omop-db`, `orthanc`) need `fsGroup`/chown init
  containers before they can run non-root.

## Development

### Chart Testing

```bash
# Lint the chart
make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes lint

# Render templates
make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes template

# Test all FL backends
make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes template-all-backends

# Full validation
make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes test
```

### CI Validation

The chart is validated in CI via:

1. `helm lint` — static chart validation
2. `helm template` — template rendering for all backends
3. `helm template` with all services disabled — verifies empty rendering
4. `kubeconform` — schema validation against Kubernetes 1.28+
5. kind-based e2e — deploys the chart to a kind cluster and verifies pods start

## Troubleshooting

### Pods stuck in Pending

| Cause | Check | Fix |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| **PVC binding** | `kubectl describe pod <name> -n <ns>` — look for `FailedBinding` events | Ensure a default StorageClass exists or set `persistence.storageClassName` per service. For ReadWriteMany volumes (shared-images), verify the cluster has a RWX-capable provisioner (e.g., EFS, Longhorn, NFS). |
| **Resource limits** | Pod requests may exceed node capacity | Check node resources: `kubectl describe nodes`. Reduce `resources.requests` or add worker nodes. |
| **GPU unschedulable** | `kubectl describe pod <fl-client>` shows `nvidia.com/gpu` in `Status` | Verify NVIDIA GPU Operator is installed. Check node labels: `kubectl get nodes -o json \| jq '.items[].metadata.labels' \| grep nvidia` |
| **Image pull** | Pod event shows `ErrImagePull` or `ImagePullBackOff` | Verify GHCR credentials. Check `imagePullSecrets` config. For private repos ensure `image.tag` exists. |

### Pods in CrashLoopBackOff

| Cause | Check | Fix |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| **Missing secrets** | `kubectl logs <pod> -n <ns>` shows auth/connection errors | Verify the Secret exists: `kubectl get secret -n <ns>`. Compare keys against the [Secrets Reference](#secrets-reference). |
| **Bad env vars** | `kubectl exec <pod> -n <ns> -- env` shows empty/wrong URLs | Check ConfigMap values. For trust-api, verify `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` is reachable. |
| **DB unreachable** | trust-api / imaging-api logs show DB connection errors | If using external DB: verify `external.host:port` is correct and firewall allows. For in-cluster DB: check the StatefulSet pod is running. |
| **Init container failed** | `kubectl logs <pod> -c <init-container> -n <ns>` | For fl-client: check S3 bucket exists and access keys are valid. For omop-db-init: verify PVC is bound. |

### FL client won't connect

1. **S3 kit download failed**: Check the `kit-init` init container logs. Verify `s3-access-key-id` and `s3-secret-access-key` in the Secret are correct and the bucket path exists.
2. **Kit path mismatch**: Verify `flClient.nvflare.kitFromS3.pathTemplate` or `flClient.flower.kitFromS3.pathTemplate` resolves to a valid S3 path. The `tpl` function renders `.Values.trustName` so ensure `trustName` is set.
3. **Network policy blocking**: Check egress CIDRs allow reaching the Central Hub and FL server. Temporarily disable policies with `--set networkPolicies.enabled=false` to isolate.
4. **GPU not visible**: Verify `nvidia.com/gpu` annotation on the fl-client pod. Check CUDA env vars (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`) are set via `flClient.gpu.enabled: true`.
5. **Flower superlink**: For Flower backend, verify `flClient.flower.superlink` is a reachable gRPC endpoint and root certificates are in the kit.
6. **Staged kit not mounted**: With the active backend's `kitFromS3.enabled=false`, verify `flClient.kitHostPath` is set and the node directory is readable by the client's runtime uid (NVFLARE 1000, Flower 49999) — unset, the kit volume renders empty with no deploy-time error and the client starts without credentials.

### Network policy blocking intra-service traffic

Symptoms: trust-api can't reach imaging-api or data-access-api (connection timeout).

1. Check namespace labels: the `allow-intra-namespace` policy uses `namespaceSelector` matching `kubernetes.io/metadata.name: <namespace>`. Verify the label exists.
2. Check if `allowKubeSystemIngress` needs to be enabled for your CNI (e.g., Cilium, Calico with strict policies).
3. Temporarily disable network policies to isolate: `helm upgrade trust-release . --set networkPolicies.enabled=false`
4. Re-enable with `networkPolicies.enabled=true` and add specific `allowedEgressCIDRs` for the Central Hub and FL server.

### XNAT takes very long to start

| Cause | Check | Fix |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| **Heap too small** | `kubectl logs <xnat-web-pod> -n <ns>` shows GC/OutOfMemoryError | Increase `xnat.web.env.XNAT_MAX_HEAP` (default `3072m`). For large datasets, set to `4096m` or higher. |
| **DB init** | Postgres init on first deploy loads schema | First start can take 2-5 minutes. Check `xnat-db` pod for `pg_isready` success. |
| **Plugin loading** | XNAT loads plugins at startup | No workaround — plugins are image-baked. Each plugin adds ~30s startup time. |
| **PVC speed** | Slow storage class delays archive/DB I/O | Use SSD-backed storage classes (e.g., `gp3` on EKS, `Premium` on AKS). |

### Orthanc / OMOP init job fails

**Orthanc**:

- Check `orthanc-registered-users` secret — must be valid JSON. Test with `echo '<value>' | python3 -m json.tool`.
- Orthanc uses SQLite embedded DB — `replicas` must stay at 1. The PVC is `ReadWriteOnce`.

**OMOP init job** (`omop-db-init-job`):

- The init Job is a Helm `post-install,post-upgrade` hook that downloads and restores OMOP data from S3.
- If the Job fails: check `s3-bucket` and `s3-path` values. Verify `s3-access-key-id` / `s3-secret-access-key` in the Secret.
- PVC name must match the StatefulSet's `volumeClaimTemplates` — the Job expects a PVC named `<release-name>-omop-db-data`.
- To re-run: `helm upgrade trust-release . --set omopDb.initJob.enabled=true` or delete the Job and let Helm re-create it.

**OMOP vocabulary load** (`omop-vocab-load`):

- Cohorts come back empty but every pod is healthy → the vocabulary was never loaded.
  Check with `kubectl get job -n <ns> -l app.kubernetes.io/component=omop-vocab-load`.
  **No Job at all** means `omopDb.vocabLoad.s3Bucket` is empty and the hook was skipped
  by design — see "OMOP core vocabulary" above.
- `aws s3 cp` denied in the `fetch-bundle` initContainer → wrong bucket for this
  environment (each env reads its own; no cross-account read), or no credentials
  (`omopDb.initJob.hostAwsMount` for local clusters, IRSA on EKS).
- `/flip/omop/load_core_vocab.sh: No such file or directory` → the `omopDb.image.tag`
  in use predates FLIP#842; repull a CI-published tag.
- Re-running `helm upgrade` is safe *and* cheap. The Job runs three stages —
  `probe-vocab` asks the database what is missing, `fetch-bundle` downloads the
  bundle only if something is, then `load-vocab` loads it. On an upgrade where the
  vocabulary is already loaded the probe logs `Core vocabulary already present in
  every table`, the fetch logs `skipping bundle fetch`, and no multi-GB download
  happens. The loader still runs (it re-applies the FK constraints, so a previous
  run that died between the load and the constraints heals here).
- `probe-vocab` fails with `omop-db not reachable after 60 attempts` → the database
  never became ready within five minutes. This is a hard failure: the Pod fails,
  and after `backoffLimit` so does the release. Check the `omop-db` pod and the
  init Job that restores its PVC. (`load-vocab` waits the same way and fails the
  same way, which is what stops a database restart during a long download from
  discarding the bundle that was just fetched.)
- A database that *is* reachable but cannot answer the probe — wrong password,
  `omop` schema absent — is treated differently: the probe leaves its marker
  unwritten and the Job falls through to a full fetch-and-load rather than
  failing, because a needless download is recoverable and a wrongly-skipped load
  is silent. The loader then reports the real error.
- The Job reaches no host but S3. `fetch-bundle` only downloads the zip; the
  loader unpacks it with the `unzip` baked into the `omop-db` image, so nothing
  is installed at run time and no package mirror has to be on the egress
  allowlist. `unzip: not found` in `load-vocab` means the `omopDb.image.tag` in
  use predates this — repull a CI-published tag.

### Getting help

If the above doesn't resolve your issue, please open a GitHub issue at:
<https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues/new>

Include:

- `helm version` and `kubectl version` output
- `kubectl describe pod -n <ns>` for the affected pod(s)
- `kubectl logs -n <ns> <pod-name>` output (redact secrets)
- Your `values.yaml` overrides (redact sensitive keys)

## Known Limitations

1. **Pod Security for stateful services**: the namespace enforces the Baseline
   profile and audits/warns against Restricted. The stateless APIs are hardened,
   but `xnat-web`, `xnat-db`, `omop-db`, and `orthanc` still need image and
   volume-permission work before the namespace can enforce Restricted.

2. **XNAT Container Service — single-node by default**: DICOM-to-NIfTI
   conversion runs end-to-end on Kubernetes (FLIP#565). The Container Service
   spawns each `dcm2niix` Job with the `xnat-web` data PVC mounted, configured by
   `combined-pvc-name` + `combined-path-translation` in the Kubernetes backend
   entry of the `xnat-cs-config` ConfigMap. Because the Job mounts the *same* PVC
   as `xnat-web`, the chart default `ReadWriteOnce` only works when the Job is
   scheduled onto the node running `xnat-web` — true for a single-node cluster.
   For multi-node, give the XNAT data volume a `ReadWriteMany` storage class
   (`xnat.web.persistence.accessMode: ReadWriteMany`, e.g. NFS/EFS). See
   [TROUBLESHOOTING.md §2.3b](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the failure modes,
   including the trailing slash that `combined-path-translation` must keep.

3. **Orthanc SQLite**: Orthanc uses an embedded SQLite database that cannot be
   shared across multiple pod replicas. The chart configures Orthanc with
   `replicas: 1` and a `ReadWriteOnce` PVC.

4. **Alloy log collection**: In the K8s deployment, Alloy runs as a DaemonSet
   reading pod log files from the host filesystem, replacing the Docker socket
   approach used in the compose deployment.
