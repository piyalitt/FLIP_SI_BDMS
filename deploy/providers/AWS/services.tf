# FLIP application S3 buckets
############################
#
# The previous single `aws_s3_bucket.flip_bucket` held three tenants with
# materially different access patterns:
#
#   - model file uploads (researcher → browser POST → AV-scan → flip-api reads)
#   - FL results (fl-server writes; researcher downloads via browser GET)
#   - FL app bundles (server-only — flip-api copies base → destination)
#
# CORS is bucket-wide in S3, so colocating these three tenants forced any
# CORS change to widen across every consumer. Splitting into three buckets
# gives each tenant the minimum CORS surface it needs:
#
#   - flip-model-files-uploads: CORS POST (presigned POST policy enforces a
#     content-length-range cap and optional Content-Type at the S3 edge —
#     see flip-api/src/flip_api/utils/s3_client.py::get_put_presigned_post)
#   - flip-fl-results: CORS GET (browser presigned download)
#   - flip-app-bundles: no CORS resource (server-only, never browser-direct)
#
# State migration: the old `aws_s3_bucket.flip_bucket` resource and its
# sub-resources are dropped from this stack via `removed` blocks at the
# bottom of this file. The underlying AWS bucket is left in place so its
# contents can be migrated and verified out-of-band (`make migrate-flip-bucket`)
# before manual decommission.

# Decommission of the old single-bucket layout
############################
#
# The previous design colocated three tenants under `aws_s3_bucket.flip_bucket`
# (see the head of this file for the rationale). These `removed` blocks tell
# Terraform to forget those resources from state without destroying the
# underlying AWS bucket — the bucket holds production data that is migrated
# out-of-band via `make migrate-flip-bucket` and then manually decommissioned
# (`aws s3 rb`) after a cooldown.
#
# `lifecycle { destroy = false }` is what makes this safe: without it,
# `removed` would attempt to delete the AWS resource on the next apply and
# the original `prevent_destroy = true` on `aws_s3_bucket.flip_bucket` would
# block the plan. Safe to drop these blocks once every live state file has
# been applied and the old bucket has been decommissioned in every env.
