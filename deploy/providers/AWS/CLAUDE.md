## Key Deploy Commands

```bash
make full-deploy PROD=stag                   # Full staging deploy
make full-deploy PROD=true                    # Full prod deploy
make init/plan/apply PROD=lza                 # LZA FLIPProduction (env-gated; full-deploy chains untested there — see README "Deploying to the LZA account")
make full-deploy-hybrid PROD=<stag|true> [LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<ip>]  # Hybrid with on-prem trust
make full-deploy-hub-only PROD=<stag|true>    # Hub only, NO cloud Trust EC2 (all trusts on-prem, e.g. GPU hosts) — see README "Hub-only Deployment"
make init/plan/apply                          # Terraform workflow
make deploy-centralhub                        # ECS deploy at env branch tip via sha-<short7> task-def revisions + CloudFront UI (FLIP#751; TAG= to pin)
make rollback-centralhub                      # Repoint ECS services at the previous ACTIVE task-def revision + deregister the rolled-away one
make deploy-trust                             # Deploy trust stack to EC2
make deploy-ui                                # Build + sync UI to S3 + invalidate CloudFront
make status                                   # Health checks

## Infrastructure

- **VPC**: 10.0.0.0/16, 2 AZs, public + private subnets
- **ECS Fargate**: Central Hub services (flip-api, fl-api-net-1, fl-server-net-1)
- **EC2**: Trust host (t3.xlarge, private subnet, SSM-only access)
- **RDS**: PostgreSQL in private subnets. In production flip-api connects through **RDS Proxy** using **IAM auth** (short-lived per-connection tokens); the proxy uses the RDS-managed master secret to reach the DB, so secret rotation no longer takes flip-api down (FLIP#556). No `rds_iam` Postgres grant is needed.
- **ALB**: Internal (`internal = true`, private subnets); HTTPS termination for `/api/*` reached via CloudFront VPC origin (no public IP)
- **NLB**: gRPC for FL server traffic
- **CloudFront + S3**: flip-ui static hosting
- **Secrets Manager**: `FLIP_API` secret (AES key, DB password, key hashes)
- **Cognito**: `flip-user-pool` with email auth
- **Container registry**: **GHCR** (`ghcr.io/londonaicentre/`) for every FLIP image (flip-api, flare-fl-api, flare-fl-server, flower-superlink, trust-api, imaging-api, data-access-api, orthanc, omop-db, XNAT). ECS Fargate task definitions pull directly from GHCR — `var.docker_registry` in `variables.tf` defaults to it; trust EC2 / on-prem hosts do too. **There is no ECR mirror.** A surgical centralhub redeploy (per `project_prod_ecs_deploy.md` — don't `make apply` for prod) is now one command: GH workflow `workflow_dispatch` to build the branch image to GHCR (publishes `sha-<short7>`) → `make deploy-centralhub TAG=sha-<short7>`, which registers new task-definition revisions and repoints the services (FLIP#751 — the previously manual register-task-definition + update-service runbook). The flip-ui bundle ships separately via `make deploy-ui` (it's static assets in S3, not a container image).

## Verifying a Central-Hub FL redeploy

An FL redeploy is `make deploy-centralhub` (branch-tip resolution, or `TAG=sha-<short7>` for a pinned build) — it registers new task-definition revisions for `fl-server-net-1` / `fl-api-net-1` pinning the immutable sha tag and repoints the services at them (FLIP#751; the old flow re-pulled the mutable `:stag`/`:prod` tag via `update-service --force-new-deployment`). Note it also rolls `flip-api` to the same tag and finishes with `make deploy-ui`, which builds `flip-ui` **from your local working tree** — run it from a clean checkout of the deployed branch. To confirm the new image is actually running, compare the task's image digest to the GHCR tag — **but select the container by name, not by array index**:

- `aws ecs describe-tasks` returns `containers` as an array, and the **GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring sidecar** (`aws-guardduty-agent-*`) usually sorts first. Querying `containers[0].imageDigest` reads the *agent's* digest, not the FL container's.
- The GuardDuty agent image lives in an AWS-internal ECR, **never GHCR**, so its digest returns **HTTP 404** when looked up in `ghcr.io`. A 404 digest is the sidecar — not a stale FL image. (This burned a full investigation on 2026-06-24: `66446df3…` was the GuardDuty agent; the real `fl-server-net-1` digest `29b10362…` matched `:stag` exactly. Both `flare-fl-server:stag` and `flare-fl-api:stag` were rebuilt by the #624 FL-deps merge, configs created `15:54–15:55Z`.)
- Always query `tasks[0].containers[?name=='fl-server-net-1'].imageDigest`. Full verification recipe (GHCR token, manifest digest, config `created` timestamp) is in [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md` §1.9](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## State Management

- Remote state in S3 (`FLIP_TFSTATE_BUCKET_NAME`) with DynamoDB locking
- Persistent resources (S3, Secrets, Cognito) preserved during destroy
- `make import-persistent` to import pre-existing resources
