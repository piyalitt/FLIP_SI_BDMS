# CLAUDE.md — AWS Deployment

## Re-read the user prompt (user standing instruction)

YOU MUST READ MY PROMPT AGAIN AND CHECK ALL THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY GET WHAT I WANT IN THE PROMPT.

Before planning, before the first tool call, and again before you finish:
1. Re-read the current user prompt in full. Do not rely on a remembered summary.
2. Check every requirement, constraint, example, exclusion, path, format, and success criterion the prompt actually contains.
3. Confirm the work matches that list with nothing missing, substituted, or silently dropped. If anything is still unclear or blocked, ask once for that blocker only.

## Key Deploy Commands

```bash
make full-deploy PROD=stag                   # Full staging deploy
make full-deploy PROD=true                    # Full prod deploy
make full-deploy-hybrid PROD=<stag|true> [LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<ip>]  # Hybrid with on-prem trust
make full-deploy-hub-only PROD=<stag|true>    # Hub only, NO cloud Trust EC2 (all trusts on-prem, e.g. GPU hosts) — see README "Hub-only Deployment"
make init/plan/apply                          # Terraform workflow
make deploy-centralhub                        # ECS deploy at env branch tip via sha-<short7> task-def revisions + CloudFront UI (FLIP#751; TAG= to pin). Prints an FL quiesce reminder (FLIP#770): enable Deployment Mode (pauses FL job pickup) + wait for the running job before deploying; GET /fl/quiesce reports deployment_mode + fl_quiesced. PROD=true additionally asks "Are you sure you want to continue?" (stag stays non-interactive)
make rollback-centralhub                      # Repoint ECS services at the previous ACTIVE task-def revision + deregister the rolled-away one
make deploy-trust                             # Deploy trust stack to EC2
make deploy-ui                                # Build + sync UI to S3 + invalidate CloudFront (excludes ark_demo/*)
make deploy-ark-demo                          # Build the public Ark+ demo SPA + sync to S3 under ark_demo/ + invalidate /ark_demo/*
make status                                   # Health checks
make ssh-config                               # Generate SSH config with SSM ProxyCommand
make forward-trust                            # SSM port forward all trust UIs
make provision-local-trust                     # Provision an on-prem trust host (run ON the host)
make allow-local-trust-nlb LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<ip>  # Open the FL-server NLB to a trust's reported IP
make package-onprem-trust-kit KIT=<CODE>      # Tarball a filled-in trust/.env.<CODE>.<env> + FL kit slice for an on-prem operator
make delete-trust NAME=<name>                 # Hard-delete a trust on the hub (frees the slot)
make add-fl-kits N=<n> PROD=<stag|true>       # Ensure N more claimable FL kit slots — activate spares first, mint only the shortfall (NVFLARE; no restart — see README)
make apply-fl-kit-slots                       # Targeted plan/apply of the /flip/fl_kit_slot_names SSM parameter (slot activation path)
make destroy                                  # Selective destroy (preserves Cognito, Secrets, S3)
make aws-login                                # AWS SSO login
```

## Infrastructure

- **VPC**: 10.0.0.0/16, 2 AZs, public + private subnets
- **ECS Fargate**: Central Hub services (flip-api, fl-api-net-1, fl-server-net-1). The FL task families serve **both FL backends** (FLIP#566): `FL_BACKEND` switches image/ports/command/env/mounts — NVFLARE (single port `FL_SERVER_PORT`, EFS kit from `fl-flare-participant-kits/<FLARE_KIT_DATE>`) vs Flower (SuperLink 9092 Fleet/9093 Exec/9097 health, TLS + SuperNode auth, creds from `fl-flower-participant-kits/<FLOWER_KIT_DATE>`, shared `fl_jobs` EFS volume, register-supernode-keys one-shot). The NLB listener stays on `FL_SERVER_PORT` for both; only the target-side port changes.
- **EC2**: Trust host (t3.xlarge, private subnet, SSM-only access)
- **RDS**: PostgreSQL in private subnets. In production flip-api connects through **RDS Proxy** using **IAM auth** (short-lived per-connection tokens); the proxy uses the RDS-managed master secret to reach the DB, so secret rotation no longer takes flip-api down (FLIP#556). No `rds_iam` Postgres grant is needed.
- **ALB**: Internal (`internal = true`, private subnets); HTTPS termination for `/api/*` reached via CloudFront VPC origin (no public IP)
- **NLB**: gRPC for FL server traffic
- **CloudFront + S3**: flip-ui static hosting
- **Secrets Manager**: `FLIP_API` secret (AES key, DB password, key hashes)
- **Cognito**: `flip-user-pool` with email auth
- **Container registry**: **GHCR** (`ghcr.io/londonaicentre/`) for every FLIP image (flip-api, flare-fl-api, flare-fl-server, flower-superlink, trust-api, imaging-api, data-access-api, orthanc, omop-db, XNAT). ECS Fargate task definitions pull directly from GHCR — `var.docker_registry` in `variables.tf` defaults to it; trust EC2 / on-prem hosts do too. **There is no ECR mirror.** A surgical centralhub redeploy (per `project_prod_ecs_deploy.md` — don't `make apply` for prod) is now one command: GH workflow `workflow_dispatch` to build the branch image to GHCR (publishes `sha-<short7>`) → `make deploy-centralhub TAG=sha-<short7>`, which registers new task-definition revisions and repoints the services (FLIP#751 — the previously manual register-task-definition + update-service runbook). The flip-ui bundle ships separately via `make deploy-ui` (it's static assets in S3, not a container image).

## Verifying a Central-Hub FL redeploy

An FL redeploy is `make deploy-centralhub` (branch-tip resolution, or `TAG=sha-<short7>` for a pinned build) — it registers new task-definition revisions for `fl-server-net-1` / `fl-api-net-1` pinning the immutable sha tag and repoints the services at them (FLIP#751; the old flow re-pulled the mutable `:stag`/`:prod` tag via `update-service --force-new-deployment`). Note it also rolls `flip-api` to the same tag and finishes with `make deploy-ui`, which builds `flip-ui` **from your local working tree** — run it from a clean checkout of the deployed branch. To confirm the new image is actually running, compare the task's image digest to the GHCR tag — **but select the container by name, not by array index**:

- `aws ecs describe-tasks` returns `containers` as an array, and the **GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring sidecar** (`aws-guardduty-agent-*`) usually sorts first. Querying `containers[0].imageDigest` reads the *agent's* digest, not the FL container's.
- The GuardDuty agent image lives in an AWS-internal ECR, **never GHCR**, so its digest returns **HTTP 404** when looked up in `ghcr.io`. A 404 digest is the sidecar — not a stale FL image. (This burned a full investigation on 2026-06-24: `66446df3…` was the GuardDuty agent; the real `fl-server-net-1` digest `29b10362…` matched `:stag` exactly. Both `flare-fl-server:stag` and `flare-fl-api:stag` were rebuilt by the #624 FL-deps merge, configs created `15:54–15:55Z`.)
- Always query `tasks[0].containers[?name=='fl-server-net-1'].imageDigest`. Full verification recipe (GHCR token, manifest digest, config `created` timestamp) is in [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md` §1.9](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## State Management

- Remote state in S3 (`FLIP_TFSTATE_BUCKET_NAME`) with S3 native locking (`use_lockfile = true` in `backend.tf`; no DynamoDB lock table)
- Persistent resources (S3, Secrets, Cognito) preserved during destroy
- `make import-persistent` to import pre-existing resources
