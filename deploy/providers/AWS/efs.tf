# EFS for fl-api and fl-server provisioned-secret directories. On the EC2 host
# these live at /opt/flip/services/... and are populated by Ansible. On Fargate
# tasks lose local state on every restart, so the cert/admin/transfer
# directories must persist on EFS and be mounted via access points.
#
# Access points use posix_user uid/gid 1001 — never root. The FL service
# Dockerfiles run as a non-root user that must match this uid.

# resources allowing ingress 2049 from the ecs_fl_api and ecs_fl_server SGs
# (which PR 2 also creates).
#
# No egress rule by design: EFS mount targets terminate NFS traffic at the
# ENI and never initiate outbound connections, so denying egress costs
# nothing. AWS provider 4.x stopped auto-creating the 0.0.0.0/0 egress that
# older docs assume — calling out the omission here so the next reader
# doesn't assume it's an oversight (see feedback_sg_egress.md).
