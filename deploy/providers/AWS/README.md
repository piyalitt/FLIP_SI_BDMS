# FLIP AWS Terraform/OpenTofu and Ansible Infrastructure

Terraform/OpenTofu and Ansible Infrastructure as Code to deploy the FLIP application stack to AWS.

This provider manages the **Central Hub** (always in AWS) and, optionally, one or more **Trust** instances. Trust services can be deployed in two ways:

| Deployment Model | Trust Location | Managed By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cloud** | AWS EC2 (same account as Central Hub) | This provider (`deploy/providers/AWS/`) |
| **Hybrid / On-Premises** | Any Ubuntu host (home lab, hospital server, etc.) | [`deploy/providers/local/`](../local/README.md) + selected targets in this Makefile |
| **Kubernetes** | Any Kubernetes cluster 1.28+ (EKS, AKS, on-prem) | [`deploy/providers/kubernetes/`](../kubernetes/README.md) Helm chart |

In both models, trusts poll the Central Hub for tasks over HTTPS — all communication is **outbound from the trust** to the hub. The hub never makes inbound requests to trusts.

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI configured** with SSO access (see [deploy README](../../README.md))
2. **Terraform >= 1.13.1** or OpenTofu installed
3. **Python 3.12+**
4. **UV environment manager** installed via [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/)
5. **GitHub CLI** installed via [GitHub CLI installation guide](https://cli.github.com/)
6. **SSH key pair** created at `~/.ssh/host-aws` (see [deploy README](../../README.md))
7. **Environment files** configured: (see [deploy README](../../README.md))
   - `.env.stag` (staging), `.env.production` (production), or `.env.lza-prod` (LZA FLIPProduction) in project root
   - Service-specific `.env` files (see Environment Configuration section)

### Required AWS Permissions

Your AWS IAM role/user needs the following permissions for provisioning infrastructure:

- **SSM**: `ssm:GetParameter` for fetching AMI IDs; `ssm:PutParameter` / `ssm:GetParameter` on the Parameter Store entries consumed by ECS tasks
- **EC2 / VPC**: Full access (VPC, instances, security groups, key pairs, Elastic IPs, NAT gateway, interface + gateway VPC endpoints)
- **RDS**: `rds:CreateDBSubnetGroup`, `rds:CreateDBParameterGroup`, `rds:CreateDBInstance`
- **CloudWatch Logs**: `logs:*` (ECS task logs and WAF logs both land here)
- **Secrets Manager**: Full access for storing database credentials and API secrets
- **IAM**: Create and manage roles for EC2 instances and ECS task execution / task roles
- **Application + Network Load Balancers**: Create and manage both the ALB (HTTPS API traffic) and the NLB (FL server TCP/gRPC traffic)
- **ECS / Fargate**: `ecs:*` (cluster, task definitions, services). Task images come from **GHCR** (`ghcr.io/londonaicentre/...`) — no AWS-side image registry permissions needed (no ECR mirror). The bootstrap EFS-provisioning image (`amazon/aws-cli`) comes from Docker Hub and is also fetched through the NAT gateway, so private ECR API/DKR endpoints are not required.
- **EFS**: `elasticfilesystem:*` for the shared workspace volumes mounted into FL Fargate tasks
- **CloudFront + WAFv2**: Create and manage the UI distribution and the WebACL attached to it
- **ACM**: Issue / import certificates in both `eu-west-2` (ALB origin) and `us-east-1` (CloudFront viewer)
- **Route53**: Manage A-records for the canonical subdomain (CloudFront alias) and the FL-server NLB
- **Service Discovery (Cloud Map)**: Create the private DNS namespace used for ECS task-to-task resolution
- **SES**: Manage email templates (optional for email functionality)

Managed policies that cover these requirements:

- `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
- `AmazonECS_FullAccess`
- `AmazonRDSFullAccess`
- `AmazonElasticFileSystemFullAccess`
- `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess`
- `SecretsManagerReadWrite`
- `IAMFullAccess`
- `ElasticLoadBalancingFullAccess` (covers ALB and NLB)
- `CloudFrontFullAccess`
- `AWSWAFFullAccess`
- `AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess`
- `AmazonRoute53FullAccess`
- `AWSCloudMapFullAccess`
- `AmazonSSMFullAccess`
- `AmazonSESFullAccess` (optional)

**Note**: The deployed EC2 instances use separate, scoped IAM roles following the principle of least privilege:

- **Central Hub bastion** (`ec2-role`): `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` only. Application permissions belong to the ECS task roles; the bastion cannot read FLIP secrets or buckets and cannot call Cognito, SES, or CloudWatch Logs.
- **Trust EC2** (`trust-ec2-role`): SSM + CloudWatch managed policies, plus a read-only S3 inline policy on the AI Centre bucket for FL participant-kit downloads. No Cognito, SES, Secrets Manager or FLIP application bucket access.

## Deployment Workflow

### Full Stack Deployment

The complete deployment process is automated via the `full-deploy` target:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
make full-deploy PROD=stag  # For staging
# OR
make full-deploy PROD=true  # For production
```

This command executes the following steps in order:

1. **`github-login`**: Authenticate with GitHub CLI
2. **`aws-login`**: Authenticate with AWS SSO
3. **`init`**: Initialize Terraform with environment-specific S3 backend
4. **`import-persistent`**: Import existing persistent AWS resources to prevent replacement
5. **`generate-internal-service-key`**: Mint the fl-server → hub `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` (idempotent — skipped if already set)
6. **`plan`**: Generate and review the initial Terraform execution plan
7. **`apply`**: Apply infrastructure changes
8. **`update-env`**: Refresh the root environment file with Terraform outputs
9. **`ssh-config`**: Update `~/.ssh/config` with SSM-managed EC2 instance IDs
10. **`ansible-init`**: Patch both hosts, install `psql` on the Central Hub bastion, and provision Docker, AWS CLI, CloudWatch, and FL assets on the Trust EC2
11. **`deploy-centralhub`**: Deploy the Central Hub ECS Fargate services (`flip-api`, `fl-api-net-1`, `fl-server-net-1`) at the tip of the env's branch via new task-definition revisions (see [Central Hub deploys and rollback](#central-hub-deploys-and-rollback-immutable-sha-tags)) and sync the UI to S3 + invalidate CloudFront
12. **`register-trusts`**: Register every locally-present trust kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`) on the running hub and fill each kit with hub-shared values
13. **`deploy-trust`**: Deploy Trust services via Docker Compose to the Trust EC2
14. **`status`**: Run comprehensive health checks

To provision only the minimal Central Hub bastion after a targeted Terraform
change, run `make provision-bastion PROD=stag|true`; this does not touch the
Trust EC2.

### Hub-only Deployment (all trusts on-prem)

Use `full-deploy-hub-only` when no trust should run in the cloud — typically because the
FL workloads need hardware the trust EC2 doesn't have (it's a GPU-less `t3.xlarge`) and
every trust will run on-prem hosts instead:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
make full-deploy-hub-only PROD=stag   # or PROD=true
make deploy-ui PROD=stag              # UI ships separately, same as full-deploy
```

This runs the same chain as `full-deploy` minus the cloud-trust steps (`deploy-trust`,
`seed-trust-data`) and sets `DEPLOY_TRUST_EC2=false`, so Terraform provisions **no Trust
EC2 at all** (`ssh-config` skips the `flip-trust` alias and the `trust_ec2` Ansible plays
are no-ops). The cloud-trust targets fail fast with a pointer to the on-prem flow if run
against a hub-only environment.

> **Warning**: on an environment previously deployed with `full-deploy`, the hub-only
> `apply` **destroys the existing Trust EC2** (its data volumes are not preserved).
> Re-run with `DEPLOY_TRUST_EC2=true` (the default) to bring one back.

Each on-prem trust then joins exactly as in the hybrid flow:

1. Add the trust host's public IP to `LOCAL_TRUST_PUBLIC_IPS` in the env file, then
   `make allow-local-trust-nlb PROD=<env>` (one NLB ingress rule per IP).
2. Scaffold + register the kit: `make new-trust TRUST_CODE=<CODE> TRUST_NAME="..." TRUST_REGION=... PROD=<env>`
   then `make register-trusts KIT=<CODE> PROD=<env>` (the `full-deploy-hub-only` chain
   already registers every kit file present at deploy time).
3. On the trust host: stage the FL kit (`make provision-local-trust KIT=<CODE>` on the
   host, or point `FL_KIT_DIR` in the kit at a locally-provisioned workspace) and start
   the stack: `env PROD=<env> make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE>`.

Multiple on-prem trusts can share one host — give each kit non-colliding ports and data
directories (see the shipped `trust/.env.*.development.example` kits for a working
two-trust port allocation).

### flip-ui on S3 + CloudFront

The UI is served from S3 behind CloudFront at the canonical user-facing subdomain (`stag.flip.aicentre.co.uk` / `app.flip.aicentre.co.uk`). CloudFront also forwards `/api/*` to the ALB, using a backend-only `api.<subdomain>` DNS name that only CloudFront uses — trusts and users never see it. CloudFront is the only supported UI-hosting path; there is no legacy EC2 UI container or ALB UI target group to fall back to.

**Subsequent UI deploys**: just `make deploy-ui PROD=stag|true` — builds the UI from the working tree, regenerates `window.js`, syncs to S3, invalidates CloudFront. No Terraform involved.

### FLIP application S3 buckets

The Central Hub uses four S3 buckets, each with a distinct purpose, access pattern, and CORS surface. The three **FLIP application buckets** were split out of a single legacy `flip{env}` bucket so each tenant can carry the minimum CORS surface its consumer needs (a CORS change for one tenant no longer drags every other tenant along, and a browser-direct bucket can no longer accidentally expose objects belonging to a server-only flow).

| Bucket (per env) | Env-var (`.env.{stag,production}`) | Consumer | Browser CORS | Holds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `flip{env}-model-files-uploads` | `FLIP_MODEL_FILES_UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME` | researcher browser (presigned **PUT** on `origin/develop`; flips to presigned **POST** once [#438](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/pull/438) lands), flip-api reads | `PUT` today; narrows to `POST` from `https://<flip_alb_subdomain>` when #438 merges | researcher-uploaded model artefacts under `uploaded/` (today the AV-scanned copy reads from the same prefix — see the FIXME in `.env.production`) |
| `flip{env}-fl-results` | `FLIP_FL_RESULTS_BUCKET_NAME` | fl-server writes, researcher browser (presigned **GET**) | `GET` from `https://<flip_alb_subdomain>` | FL training output / aggregated weights — the whole bucket is dedicated to this tenant so no prefix is needed |
| `flip{env}-app-bundles` | `FLIP_APP_BUNDLES_BUCKET_NAME` | flip-api (boto3 only) | **none** (server-only — no `aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration` resource is emitted at all) | `app_destinations/<model_id>/` (per-bundle FL apps: base templates + user model files, assembled by flip-api). The base FL application templates themselves are baked into the flip-api image (FLIP#724), not stored here. |
| `flip{env}-aicentre` | `AICENTRE_BUCKET_NAME` | Trust EC2 (`aws s3 cp` during Ansible), AI Centre operators | `PUT`, `GET` | FL participant kits |

All four share standard configs: public access blocked, SSE-KMS server-side encryption with bucket keys enabled, versioning enabled. The three FLIP application buckets are rendered by the shared **`modules/flip_s3_bucket`** module, which is consumed by both `main.tf` (prod / stag) and `dev/main.tf` (dev account) — so a CORS or bucket-policy change plans identically across every environment, closing the dev-drift gap that masked the presigned-PUT → presigned-POST regression in #438.

**Base FL application templates ship in the image, not S3.** As of FLIP#724 the base FL application templates (the repo's `fl-apps/` tree) are baked into the `flip-api` image and read from a local directory (`FL_APP_BASE_DIR`, default `/app/fl-apps`); flip-api bundles applications by uploading those local templates plus the user's model files into `flip{env}-app-bundles/app_destinations/<model_id>/`. There is no longer any CI that syncs templates to S3, so the `flip{env}-app-bundles` bucket is written **only** by flip-api at bundle time. Template hotfixes therefore ship by rebuilding and redeploying the `flip-api` image (see the migration note below).

#### Migrating off the legacy single-bucket layout

For an account that was created **before** the split, the legacy `flip{env}` bucket holds the contents that now belong in the three split buckets above. **Prod and dev were migrated as part of FLIP#24** (the bucket-split PR) — see that PR's description for the as-built details and verification logs. The only environment still pending a cutover at the time of writing is **stag**; the runbook below is the canonical reference for stag and for any future fresh prod/dev account that needs the same migration.

The mechanism the runbook leans on:

- The `removed { destroy = false }` blocks in `services.tf` drop the legacy bucket from Terraform state on the first apply **without** destroying the AWS resource — that's what lets `make migrate-flip-bucket` run against the still-live source.
- `make verify-flip-bucket-migration` is the safety net for the fact that `aws s3 sync` exits 0 even when individual object copies fail (per-object KMS / throttle / timeout errors print to stderr but don't fail the sync). It computes a key-set subset check — every source key must exist on the destination; extras on the destination from post-cutover writes are allowed. Always green before `aws s3 rb`.
- There is a brief window between `make apply` finishing and `make deploy-centralhub` finishing where flip-api's IAM no longer grants the legacy bucket but its env vars still point at it — every S3 call returns 403 during that window (~5 minutes). To eliminate it, temporarily add the legacy bucket back to the IAM grant for the duration of the deploy, then strip it in a follow-up apply.

#### Stag migration runbook

Stag's Terraform state is known to be missing ~70 live resources. The `removed` blocks plan as no-ops if `aws_s3_bucket.flip_bucket` was never registered in stag state to begin with — and the next stag apply would then try to *create* whatever `FLIP_MODEL_FILES_UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME` points to. If that's set to the legacy bucket name as a typo, the apply fails on `BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou`; if it's set to a new name but the new buckets already exist in AWS from a manual create, the apply also fails. The fix is to import every persistent resource first, then run apply / migrate / verify.

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
export AWS_PROFILE=stag && make aws-login              # if SSO has expired

# 1. Bring stag's Terraform state in line with what's actually in AWS — this
#    imports the three new application buckets (if a previous run created them
#    manually), the AI Centre bucket, Secrets Manager, Cognito, SES, and ACM.
#    It does NOT import the legacy `aws_s3_bucket.flip_bucket` (that resource
#    has been removed from the configuration and replaced with `removed`
#    blocks). The `removed` blocks then plan as no-ops on the stag-state gap,
#    which is fine: nothing to remove means nothing accidentally gets removed.
#    Idempotent: rerun safely after a fix.
make import-persistent                                  # PROD unset → stag (see Makefile defaults)

# 2. Plan — confirm the diff matches the prod cutover's shape:
#    17 to add (3 new buckets), 3 to change (IAM rewires), 1 to destroy
#    (old uploaded_federated_data SSM param renamed), 8 forgotten-from-state.
#    If you see anything trying to DESTROY a bucket, stop — that means the
#    import-persistent step missed something. Don't apply.
make plan

# 3. Apply — same diff as prod.
make apply

# 4. Sync the legacy prefixes (model_files/uploaded, uploaded_federated_data,
#    app_destination_bucket) into the new buckets. (The base-application prefix
#    is no longer synced — those templates now ship in the flip-api image, FLIP#724.)
make migrate-flip-bucket

# 5. Parity-check — must print all-✅ before continuing.
make verify-flip-bucket-migration

# 6. Redeploy stag's central hub so flip-api picks up the new bucket env vars.
make deploy-centralhub

# … browser smoke against stag's URL; FL e2e; 24–48h cooldown …

# 7. Final verify + decommission.
make verify-flip-bucket-migration
aws s3 rm s3://flipstag --recursive
aws s3 rb s3://flipstag
```

Two stag-specific watch-outs:

- **`make import-persistent` failing partway through** is fine on a re-run — every import in `scripts/import-resources.sh` is idempotent (probes `terraform state list` before importing). The script will skip already-imported resources and only attempt the missing ones.
- **The task definitions applied before `deploy-centralhub` need image tags from `.env.stag`** (`DOCKER_TAG`, `DOCKER_FL_TAG`) that exist in GHCR. Branch tags do **not** auto-build on push — trigger the relevant `docker_build_*` workflows via `workflow_dispatch` before applying a branch image tag (see [the build trigger note in CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md#docker-image-builds-gated-on-tests-manual-trigger-for-branches)). These env-file tags are only Terraform's bootstrap defaults — day-to-day image deploys pin immutable `sha-<short7>` tags instead (see [Central Hub deploys and rollback](#central-hub-deploys-and-rollback-immutable-sha-tags)).

For a **future fresh prod or dev** account that needs the same migration, the flow is the stag runbook above minus step 1 (`make import-persistent` is only needed on environments with the stag-style state gap) and with `PROD=true` on every `make` call for prod (dev uses the separate `deploy/providers/AWS/dev/` Terraform root, no `PROD=` flag).

> **Do not `aws s3 rb s3://flipdev` on the legacy dev bucket.** The `test-data/` prefix in there (~42 objects) is consumed by external CI fixtures, so it is outside the scope of the FLIP#24 migration and must survive. Either leave the `flipdev` bucket alive solely for `test-data/`, or move `test-data/` to a dedicated bucket and update those references in lockstep before any `aws s3 rb`. The same constraint may apply to a `test-data/` prefix in `flipstag` / `flipprod` if one exists — check with `aws s3 ls s3://flipstag/test-data/` before decommissioning either.

Once a decommission is complete in every environment, drop the `FLIP_BUCKET_NAME` line from `.env.*`, the `removed` blocks in `services.tf`, and the `migrate-flip-bucket` / `verify-flip-bucket-migration` Makefile targets in a follow-up PR.

### Manual Step-by-Step Deployment

For debugging or selective deployment, run individual steps:

```bash
# 0. Choose the environment for this shell.
# If you omit PROD, the AWS provider Makefile defaults to staging.
export PROD=stag    # or: export PROD=true

# 1. Login to GitHub and AWS
make github-login
make aws-login

# 2. Bootstrap the Terraform backend bucket once, if needed
make create-backend

# 3. Initialize Terraform (uses the configured S3 backend)
make init

# 4. Import existing persistent resources (prevents replacement errors)
make import-persistent

# 5. Plan changes
make plan

# 6. Apply infrastructure
make apply

# 7. Configure SSH access
make ssh-config

# 8. Setup EC2 instances with Ansible
make ansible-init

# 9. Deploy the Central Hub
make deploy-centralhub

# 10. Register every locally-present trust kit file on the hub and fill each kit with hub-shared values
make register-trusts

# 11. Deploy trust services
make deploy-trust

# 12. Check status
make status
```

### Central Hub deploys and rollback (immutable SHA tags)

`make deploy-centralhub` deploys the Central Hub ECS services (`flip-api`, `fl-api-net-1`,
`fl-server-net-1`) by **immutable image tag + task-definition revision** (FLIP#751), then publishes
the UI (same as `make deploy-ui`):

1. Resolves `TAG=sha-<short7>` from the tip of the env's branch — `PROD=true` → `origin/main`,
   `PROD=stag` → `origin/develop` (`git fetch` runs inside the target). The tag must match
   `sha-<7 hex chars>` — a mutable tag (e.g. a stray `TAG=stag`) is rejected before any AWS call.
2. Verifies **every** service's image exists in GHCR at that tag **before mutating anything** — a
   missing tag aborts with nothing deployed. The build workflows are path-filtered, so a merge that
   didn't touch a service (most commonly a flip-api-only merge, which does not rebuild the FL
   images) leaves that service without an image at the new tip; flip-api's build is additionally
   test-gated (`workflow_run` on its test suite), so right after a merge its tag may still be
   building. The guard names the workflow to check; trigger the missing build manually
   (`gh workflow run <workflow>.yml --ref <branch>` builds the branch tip and publishes its sha
   tag), then re-run the deploy. A non-404 registry error (outage, auth) is reported as such —
   don't dispatch rebuilds for it. Non-`ghcr.io` registries skip the manifest check entirely
   (LZA ECR pull-through cache, FLIP#749).
3. Per service: registers a new task-definition revision with only the app container's image tag
   swapped (containers are selected **by name**, never by index — the same convention as the
   `describe-tasks` digest check in [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md` §1.9](TROUBLESHOOTING.md), robust to
   sidecar/ordering changes) and repoints the service at the new revision. If the repoint fails,
   the just-registered revision is deregistered again so the `max()` tracking in
   `ecs_services.tf` cannot adopt a never-deployed revision, and any services already repointed
   in the same run are listed so a partial deploy is visible.

```bash
make deploy-centralhub PROD=stag                    # deploy the tip of develop to staging
make deploy-centralhub PROD=true                    # deploy the tip of main to production
make deploy-centralhub PROD=stag TAG=sha-1a2b3c4    # pin a specific / hotfix build
make rollback-centralhub PROD=stag                  # repoint services at the previous revision
```

`TAG=sha-<short7>` overrides the branch-tip resolution — this automates the previously manual
runbook for feature-branch images: trigger the relevant `docker_build_*` / `fl-docker-build-*`
workflow on your branch via `workflow_dispatch`, wait for green, then deploy its sha tag.

`make rollback-centralhub` repoints each service at its previous ACTIVE task-definition revision —
seconds, no rebuild — then **deregisters the revision it rolled away from** (it stays describable
for forensics). The deregistration is what makes the rollback durable: `ecs_services.tf` tracks the
*latest ACTIVE* revision, so leaving the bad revision ACTIVE would have the next `terraform apply`
silently re-adopt it. It does not touch the UI bundle; re-run `make deploy-ui` from the matching
commit if the UI must move too. After a *partial* deploy (some services repointed before a
failure), don't roll back blindly — rollback moves **every** service down one revision, including
the ones the failed deploy never touched; fix the missing build and re-run the deploy instead.

The deploy ends by publishing the UI (same as `make deploy-ui`), which builds `flip-ui` **from your
local working tree** — deploy from a clean checkout of the branch you are deploying.

Terraform stays the owner of the task-definition *skeleton* (roles, env wiring, volumes). The
services track `max(Terraform revision, latest ACTIVE revision)` (see `ecs_services.tf`), so an
unrelated `terraform apply` does not roll a CLI-deployed image back. When an apply *does*
re-register a task definition, the new Terraform revision goes live with the bootstrap image tags
from the env file (`DOCKER_TAG`, `DOCKER_FL_TAG`) — re-run `make deploy-centralhub` afterwards to
roll the sha-pinned image forward again. And because `make apply` applies the saved `plan.tfplan`,
a plan generated **before** a CLI deploy snapshots the older revision and applying it would roll
the image back — re-run `make plan` after any `make deploy-centralhub`.

> **Prod rollout note:** switch *production* deploys to this flow only after the 24 Jul 2026 DECAF
> deadline (BDMS is live on legacy prod until then). Staging can adopt it immediately.

### Deployment to Different Environments

**Staging:**

```bash
make full-deploy PROD=stag
```

**Production:**

```bash
make full-deploy PROD=true
```

The `PROD` variable determines which environment files are loaded:

- `PROD=stag` → Uses the root `.env.stag`
- `PROD=true` → Uses the root `.env.production`
- `PROD=lza` → Uses the root `.env.lza-prod` (the LZA FLIPProduction account — see
  [Deploying to the LZA account](#deploying-to-the-lza-account-flipproduction))

If `PROD` is omitted when running the AWS provider Makefile, it defaults to staging.

The Makefile maps `PROD` onto `TF_VAR_environment` (`prod` when `PROD=true` or `PROD=lza`, otherwise `stag`). Terraform branches on this variable to gate prod-only RDS hardening — see [RDS lifecycle](#rds-lifecycle-stag-vs-prod). `PROD=lza` additionally sets the orthogonal `TF_VAR_lza_managed_network=true` platform-managed-network toggle.

#### AWS profile aliases

The Makefile guards refuse to apply unless `AWS_PROFILE` matches the expected profile for the chosen environment. Defaults are the short logical names `prod`, `stag`, and `dev` — add these aliases to `~/.aws/config` so commands like `AWS_PROFILE=stag make plan` work without thinking about account numbers:

```ini
[profile prod]
sso_session = FLIP
sso_account_id = <prod-sso-account-id>
sso_role_name = <sso-role-name>
region = <aws-region>
output = json

[profile stag]
sso_session = FLIP
sso_account_id = <stag-sso-account-id>
sso_role_name = <sso-role-name>
region = <aws-region>
output = json

[profile dev]
sso_session = FLIP
sso_account_id = <dev-sso-account-id>
sso_role_name = <sso-role-name>
region = <aws-region>
output = json
```

Replace each `<…>` with the matching value from the FLIP AWS account directory (kept out of the public repo).

If your local profile names differ, override the defaults via `PROD_AWS_PROFILE`, `STAG_AWS_PROFILE`, or `DEV_AWS_PROFILE` (in your env file or on the make command line).

**Dev account (Cognito + SES only):**

The dev AWS account runs only the services that cannot reasonably run locally (Cognito for auth, SES for email). A separate, minimal Terraform root lives in [`dev/`](./dev/README.md) and calls the same `modules/cognito` and `modules/ses` as this stack, so a change to either service lands in both environments from one place. The dev stack reuses `.env.development` — the same env file the local Docker Compose dev stack consumes — so there is no extra file to maintain.

The dev stack has its own Makefile; drive it from the `dev/` directory:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS/dev
make create-backend  # one-time, if the backend bucket needs bootstrapping
make init            # one-time, or after backend config changes
make plan
make apply
```

See [`dev/README.md`](./dev/README.md) for the one-time `terraform import` workflow that pulls the manually-created dev Cognito pool into state.

### Deploying to the LZA account (FLIPProduction)

[FLIP#749](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues/749) migrates the production deployment to the LZA-provisioned
**FLIPProduction** account (`893493035022`, eu-west-2). Until cutover it runs **in parallel** with legacy prod: every
LZA adaptation in this stack is env-gated behind `PROD=lza`, and with `PROD=true`/`PROD=stag` the resolved
configuration is identical to before — the legacy environments are never touched by LZA work.

**What `PROD=lza` selects:**

| Concern | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Env file | root `.env.lza-prod` (gitignored, like the other env files) |
| Profile guard | `AWS_PROFILE=FLIPAdminAccess-893493035022` (override via `LZA_AWS_PROFILE`) |
| `TF_VAR_environment` | `prod` — LZA is a production estate, so all prod-only hardening (RDS deletion protection, final snapshot) stays on |
| `TF_VAR_lza_managed_network` | `true` — the platform-managed-network toggle, orthogonal to `environment` (see below) |
| Trust kit suffix | `trust/.env.<CODE>.lza-prod` — a separate namespace so legacy prod kits are never overwritten |
| `deploy-centralhub` git ref | `origin/main` (same as legacy prod) |

**Platform-managed vs FLIP-managed.** The LZA account's network is owned by the accelerator pipeline
([londonaicentre/lza](https://github.com/londonaicentre/lza)) and VPC-layer creation is SCP-denied in-account, so with
`TF_VAR_lza_managed_network=true` Terraform:

- **skips creating**: the VPC module (VPC/subnets/NAT/IGW/EIPs), the in-account VPC endpoints (interface endpoints are
  centralised in the Network account; S3+DynamoDB gateway endpoints are platform-provided), the DHCP options, and the
  `/flip/networking/*` SSM params (legacy TGW coupling — the LZA TGW attachment is platform-managed);
- **discovers instead**: the `AWSAccelerator-eu-west-2-prod` VPC and its subnets by Name tag (`network_lza.tf`;
  override the name via `LZA_VPC_NAME`). Subnet lookups match ALL `-app-*` / `-data-*` hits, so the multi-AZ `-b`
  subnets the platform team is adding appear on the next plan without a code change;
- **places by connectivity need**: RDS instances go to the isolated **data** subnets (local routes only — nothing
  there can reach TGW/endpoints, and RDS doesn't need to); ECS tasks, the internal ALB, the RDS Proxy, EFS mount
  targets and the EC2 hosts go to the TGW-routed **app** subnets (they need the central endpoints / image pulls);
- **gates off**: the SG-drift CloudTrail→EventBridge→Lambda stack (`security.tf` — the org baseline of Control Tower
  org trail, GuardDuty, Security Hub and Config covers it) and the public FL-server NLB + target group + DNS record +
  SG rules (no IGW and VPC Block Public Access make an internet-facing NLB impossible; the FL inbound architecture is
  the open #749 WP2 decision). The `fl-server-net-1` / `fl-api-net-1` ECS services themselves still deploy — they just
  have no inbound FL path yet.

Everything else (ECS Fargate, RDS + Proxy, Cognito, S3 + CMK, Secrets Manager, SES, EFS, Cloud Map, internal ALB,
CloudFront + WAF + ACM) remains FLIP-managed exactly as on legacy prod.

**Prerequisites (already provisioned out-of-band in the account, not Terraform-managed here):**

- TF state bucket `flip-terraform-state-lza` (versioned, SSE-KMS, public access blocked). `make create-backend
  PROD=lza` is idempotent against it.
- ECR **pull-through cache rules** — the account has no internet egress, so images come from in-account mirrors over
  the central `ecr.api`/`ecr.dkr` endpoints: prefix `ghcr/` mirroring `ghcr.io` (upstream auth via a read-only GHCR
  PAT in the `ecr-pullthroughcache/ghcr` Secrets Manager secret) and the credential-less `ecr-public/` prefix
  mirroring `public.ecr.aws` (used for the EFS-provision utility image). The execution role's
  `ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage`/`ecr:CreateRepository` grant for first-pull imports IS Terraform-managed
  (`iam_ecs.tf`, LZA-gated).
- The Identity Center `FLIPAdminAccess` profile in `~/.aws/config` (an `aws configure sso` against the account).

**`.env.lza-prod`.** Carries the same keys as `.env.production` (start from that shape); the values that MUST differ,
plus the LZA-only keys:

```bash
# Terraform backend + account
FLIP_TFSTATE_BUCKET_NAME=flip-terraform-state-lza
AWS_REGION=eu-west-2

# Registry: the ghcr/ pull-through cache, NOT ghcr.io (no internet egress).
# Composes with the image names exactly like the GHCR prefix does:

# their eventual post-cutover values meanwhile (used for resource naming).
MANAGE_DNS=false

NLB_SUBDOMAIN=fl.app.flip.aicentre.co.uk

# Optional: only needed if the platform VPC template is renamed.
# LZA_VPC_NAME=AWSAccelerator-eu-west-2-prod
```

Secrets (`AES_KEY_BASE64`, `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY*`, `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD`, …) are minted fresh for the account during
the WP3 bring-up and later replaced by the carried-over legacy **values** in the WP4 data migration (so existing trust
kits and encrypted data stay valid) — never reuse the legacy Secrets Manager secret itself.

**First bring-up without DNS (`MANAGE_DNS=false`).** The zone lookup would hard-fail in a zone-less account, so
`MANAGE_DNS=false` skips it plus every Route53 record and both DNS-validated ACM certs. Consequences, all of which
revert by flipping `MANAGE_DNS=true` + `make plan`/`apply` once the zone lands:

- CloudFront serves on its default `*.cloudfront.net` domain with the default viewer certificate (no aliases —
  CloudFront only allows the default cert when no aliases are set). `terraform output CloudfrontDistributionDomain`
  prints the URL.
- The CloudFront→ALB `/api/*` origin leg runs **plain HTTP** over the private VPC-origin ENI (an ALB HTTPS listener
  needs an ISSUED cert, and issuance needs DNS validation). Viewer traffic stays HTTPS. Accepted as a bring-up-only
  limitation — the leg never leaves the VPC-origin path.
- Bucket CORS and the Cognito sign-in hostname/callback URLs follow the CloudFront default domain automatically
  (`local.ui_origin`), so uploads, downloads and sign-in work; `make deploy-ui` must generate `window.js` with
  `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` pointing at the CloudFront domain.
- Trusts polling the hub would need the CloudFront domain as `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` — fine for WP3 smoke trusts;
  the real cutover is DNS-only and happens after the zone migrates.

**Not yet on LZA** (tracked on #749):

- `make apply` will fail on the ALB and RDS subnet group until the platform team lands the multi-AZ `-b` subnets
  (both need ≥2 AZs) — the hard WP2 platform blocker.
- No FL inbound path (see the NLB gating above) — FL training across trusts waits on the WP2 ingress decision.
- The `full-deploy*` chains, `make status`/`check_status.py`, `update_env.py` and `make destroy` are untested against
  `PROD=lza` — WP3 exercises the `init`/`plan`/`apply` (+ `deploy-centralhub`/`deploy-ui`) loop first and fixes up the
  auxiliary tooling as findings come in.

```

The Central Hub application services (`flip-api`, `fl-api-net-1`, `fl-server-net-1`) run on **ECS
Fargate**. `aws_instance.ec2_instance` is an intentional minimum-viable SSM bastion for ad-hoc
PostgreSQL and network diagnostics: it runs no application containers, has no inbound security-group
rules, and carries only the SSM managed IAM policy. The ALB's `/api/*` rule and the NLB's FL-server
listener forward to ECS Fargate `target_type=ip` target groups
(`aws_lb_target_group.ecs_flip_api`, `aws_lb_target_group.ecs_fl_server_tcp`).

The Cognito and SES resources used to live at the root of the prod/stag stack. `services.tf` and `main.tf` ship `moved` blocks that re-anchor the old root addresses onto the new `module.cognito.*` / `module.ses.*` paths, so any state still on the old layout self-heals on the next plan — no manual `terraform state mv` needed. `scripts/import-resources.sh` already targets the module addresses, so a fresh import lands in the right place too.

### Destroy Infrastructure

The destroy process preserves critical resources (Cognito, Secrets, S3) while safely removing infrastructure:

```bash
make destroy
```

**What gets destroyed:**

- Trust EC2 instance
- Central Hub EC2 instance
- ECS Fargate cluster, services, task definitions, and EFS file systems
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- CloudFront distribution + WAFv2 WebACL
- Cloud Map private DNS namespace
- VPC interface + gateway endpoints
- RDS database (in `stag` only — `prod` is protected, see [RDS lifecycle](#rds-lifecycle-stag-vs-prod))
- VPC, subnets, security groups, NAT gateway
- IAM roles and policies (EC2 + ECS execution/task roles)
- SSM Parameter Store entries
- Elastic IPs

**What gets preserved:**

- Cognito User Pool and users (authentication data)
- Secrets Manager secret (FLIP_API configuration)
- S3 buckets — both the application buckets and the AI Centre bucket (see [FLIP application S3 buckets](#flip-application-s3-buckets))

#### RDS lifecycle (stag vs prod)

The RDS instance behaves differently per environment, driven by `TF_VAR_environment`:

| Setting                            | `stag` (default) | `prod` (`PROD=true`)              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `skip_final_snapshot`              | `true`           | `false`                           |
| `deletion_protection`              | `false`          | `true`                            |
| `final_snapshot_identifier_prefix` | `flip-database-final` | `flip-database-final`        |

In production, `terraform destroy` (or any `make destroy` against the prod account) will refuse to delete the RDS instance until deletion protection is removed manually, and a final snapshot named `flip-database-final-<suffix>` is taken before deletion. Staging stays disposable so trees can be torn down and rebuilt without snapshot cleanup.

### Status Checking

The deployment includes a comprehensive Python-based status checker:

```bash
make status
```

This validates:

- ✅ Terraform state and outputs
- ✅ VPC, subnets, and security group configurations
- ✅ EC2 instance health (Central Hub and Trust)
- ✅ RDS database connectivity
- ✅ Secrets Manager access
- ✅ S3 bucket accessibility
- ✅ Cognito User Pool configuration
- ✅ Docker services on the Trust EC2 and ECS services on Fargate
- ✅ HTTP endpoint availability
- ✅ SSH connectivity
- ✅ CloudWatch Logs configuration

### Accessing Trust Services (XNAT, Orthanc, Swagger Docs)

The Trust EC2 is in a private subnet with no inbound ports open. All Trust web UIs and API swagger docs are reachable via AWS Systems Manager (SSM) port forwarding.

**Prerequisites** (one-time setup):

1. AWS CLI installed and configured (`aws configure sso`)
2. AWS SSM Session Manager plugin installed:

   ```bash
   curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/ubuntu_64bit/session-manager-plugin.deb" -o /tmp/session-manager-plugin.deb
   sudo dpkg -i /tmp/session-manager-plugin.deb
   ```

**Open all port forwards in one command:**

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
make forward-trust
```

This prints a list of URLs you can paste into your browser:

| Service | Local URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XNAT | `http://localhost:8104` | Neuroimaging platform UI |
| Orthanc | `http://localhost:8042` | DICOM server UI |
| trust-api swagger | `http://localhost:8020/docs` | Trust API documentation |
| imaging-api swagger | `http://localhost:8001/docs` | Imaging API documentation |
| data-access-api swagger | `http://localhost:8010/docs` | Data access API documentation |
| Grafana | `http://localhost:3000` | Observability dashboards |

Press Ctrl+C to stop all forwards. The Central Hub UI and API are accessed via the CloudFront distribution at the canonical subdomain (e.g. `https://app.flip.aicentre.co.uk`) — no port forwarding needed. The ALB is internal (private subnets, no public IP); CloudFront reaches it through a VPC origin.

## Hybrid Deployment: Adding an On-Premises Trust

To connect a local (on-premises) Trust host to the AWS Central Hub:

Recommended orchestration target (works for both `PROD=stag` and `PROD=true`):

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
make full-deploy-hybrid PROD=<stag|true> [LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip>]
```

This wrapper target runs the full AWS deployment, provisions the on-prem trust host, and redeploys the Central Hub so the new secret values are loaded. `PROD` is inherited from the environment — omit `LOCAL_TRUST_IP` to auto-detect the operator machine's public IP via `curl ipify.org`.
You still need to:

1. Start the trust stack on the host: `cd ../../.. && env PROD=<stag|true> make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE>` (the trust code you registered)
2. Verify the trust can poll the hub (check trust-api logs for successful task polling)

Or onboard the trust step by step — the trust operator provisions their own host,
and the FLIP admin opens the firewall once the operator reports their public IP:

```bash
# On the trust host (trust operator) — provision, then start the stack
cd deploy/providers/AWS
set -x ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS (read -s -P 'Sudo password: ')   # fish; bash differs
make provision-local-trust KIT=<CODE>
cd ../../.. && env PROD=<stag|true> make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE>

# On the FLIP side (admin), once the operator reports their host's public IP:
#   add it to LOCAL_TRUST_PUBLIC_IPS (an HCL list) in .env.stag / .env.production, e.g.
#   LOCAL_TRUST_PUBLIC_IPS=["1.2.3.4"]
cd deploy/providers/AWS
make allow-local-trust-nlb LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip>
```

`allow-local-trust-nlb` runs a normal `terraform plan`/`apply` — the IPs are real config, so later full applies stay idempotent (no `-target`, no drift).

Verify the trust can poll the hub (check trust-api logs for successful task polling).

Full details are in the [local provider README](../local/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnosis

First, run the automated status check script to identify issues:

```bash
make status
```

This will automatically diagnose:

- AWS resource health
- Network connectivity
- Application endpoint availability
- Docker container status
- System resource usage

Review the output for failed checks and follow the specific troubleshooting steps below.

issues — see [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Each entry includes symptoms, root cause, and
fix.

## Architecture

### Services

The platform supports a cloud-only setup (Central Hub + Trust on AWS) or a hybrid setup (Central Hub on AWS + Trust on-premises). Trusts poll the Central Hub for tasks — all communication is outbound from the trust.

1. **flip-ui (Frontend)**: Served as static assets from an S3 bucket behind CloudFront at the canonical subdomain. See the [flip-ui on S3 + CloudFront](#flip-ui-on-s3--cloudfront) section.

2. **Central Hub application services (ECS Fargate, private subnets)**: The hub's application containers run as ECS Fargate tasks, not on EC2.
   - `flip-api` (Backend API) — fronted by the ALB on `/api/*`
   - `fl-api-net-1` (Federated Learning API for Network 1) — internal-only, reachable via Cloud Map `flip.local`
   - `fl-server-net-1` (Federated Learning Server for Network 1) — fronted by the NLB for FL client TCP traffic

3. **Central Hub SSM bastion** (`aws_instance.ec2_instance`, t3.micro, 10 GB root volume, **private subnet**): Intentional minimal host for ad-hoc `psql` and network diagnostics. It runs no application containers, has no inbound security-group rules, and is reachable only through SSM Session Manager / SSH-over-SSM.

4. **Trust EC2** (cloud model, t3.xlarge, **private subnet**): Hosts trust-related services (automatically provisioned)
   - trust-api (polls hub for tasks)
   - imaging-api
   - data-access-api
   - fl-client-net-1 (FL Client for Network 1)
   - XNAT (medical imaging platform)
   - Orthanc (DICOM server)
   - OMOP database

5. **On-Premises Trust** (hybrid model, optional): Same trust services running on a local host
   - Provisioned via [`deploy/providers/local/`](../local/README.md)
   - Polls the Central Hub over the internet via HTTPS (outbound only)

| Application Component | Runtime |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| **Central Hub (S3 + CloudFront)** | |
| FLIP UI ✅ | S3 + CloudFront (WAFv2 attached) |
| **Central Hub (ECS Fargate, private subnets)** | |
| FLIP API ✅ | Fargate task behind ALB |
| FL API ✅ | Fargate task, Cloud Map internal |
| FL Server ✅ | Fargate task behind NLB |
| **Trust Services (Docker Compose on Trust EC2, private subnet)** | |
| Trust API ✅ | Trust EC2 |
| Imaging API ✅ | Trust EC2 |
| Data Access API ✅ | Trust EC2 |
| XNAT (medical imaging) ✅ | Trust EC2 |
| Orthanc (DICOM server) ✅ | Trust EC2 |

All trust → hub traffic is **outbound from the trust** (the hub never dials the trust). Arrows
in the diagram point in the direction in which each TCP connection is *initiated*, which is also
the direction of the request flow.

### Central Hub Infrastructure

- **VPC**: Custom VPC (`10.0.0.0/16` by default) across 2 AZs, with public + private subnets and a single shared NAT Gateway
- **ECS Fargate cluster**: Runs the Central Hub application services (`flip-api`, `fl-api-net-1`, `fl-server-net-1`) as awsvpc tasks in **private subnets**. Task definitions, services, and per-service security groups live in `ecs*.tf` and `iam_ecs.tf`.
- **Central Hub SSM bastion**: t3.micro instance with a 10 GB root volume in a **private subnet**. It carries only the SSM managed IAM policy and a PostgreSQL client for ad-hoc RDS operations; application workloads run on ECS Fargate.
- **Trust EC2**: Separate t3.xlarge instance in a **private subnet**, running Trust services via Docker Compose
  - Deployed using custom Terraform module (`modules/trust_ec2`)
  - Automatic Docker and Docker Compose installation via user_data
  - Automatic Docker network creation for inter-service communication
  - No inbound ports open — access via SSM (`ssh flip-trust`) and SSM port forwarding for XNAT/Orthanc debugging (`make forward-trust`)
- **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**: HTTPS-only entrypoint for API traffic. **Internal** (`internal = true`), lives in the **private subnets** — it has no public IP and no internet-facing path. CloudFront reaches it via an `aws_cloudfront_vpc_origin` (AWS-managed ENI in this VPC). The ALB security group accepts HTTPS:443 only from the AWS-managed `CloudFront-VPCOrigins-Service-SG` (Option 2 in the AWS VPC origins docs — the documented most-restrictive pattern; a `vpc_cidr` rule would not work because AWS evaluates VPC-origin SG checks against the service-managed SG, not the ENI source IP). The `https-listener` returns 404 by default and routes `/api/*` to the `ecs-flip-api` target group (`target_type=ip`, port 8000). The legacy `http-redirect` listener on port 80 exists as a belt-and-braces fallback only — its SG has no port-80 ingress, so it is unreachable externally.
- **NLB (Network Load Balancer)**: TCP pass-through entrypoint for FL server traffic. Lives in the **public subnets**. Listens on `FL_SERVER_PORT` and forwards to the `ecs-fl-server-tcp` target group (`target_type=ip`) so the `fl-server-net-1` Fargate task receives the connection. The NLB security group ingress is allow-listed: NAT Gateway public IP (so the AWS-resident Trust EC2 can reach the FL server) plus any `local_trust_public_ip` set in the env file (so an on-prem trust can reach it). HTTP/2 gRPC framing is opaque to the NLB and forwarded as-is. **Why an NLB and not the ALB?** NVFLARE FL traffic is end-to-end mutual-TLS over gRPC, and an ALB (Layer 7) terminates TLS, which breaks NVFLARE's own certificate handshake. An NLB (Layer 4) does raw TCP pass-through, so the FL client and FL server complete their mTLS handshake untouched.
- **CloudFront + WAFv2**: Edge distribution that serves the `flip-ui` static site from S3 and forwards `/api/*` to the internal ALB via an `aws_cloudfront_vpc_origin` (HTTPS-only). A WAFv2 WebACL is attached to the distribution for L7 protection; WAF logs are shipped to CloudWatch Logs.
- **ACM**: Two certificates — one in `eu-west-2` for the ALB, one in `us-east-1` for the CloudFront viewer.
- **Route53**: `A` alias records for the canonical subdomain (→ CloudFront) and for the FL-server NLB.
- **EFS**: Shared file systems and access points used by the FL services for workspace volumes (configs, certs, transfer dir). Mount targets live in the **private subnets**.
- **Cloud Map (Service Discovery)**: Private DNS namespace `flip.local` used for ECS task-to-task resolution (e.g. `fl-api-net-1.flip.local`).
- **VPC endpoints**: Interface endpoints (Secrets Manager, SSM, CloudWatch Logs, ECR API + DKR) in the **private subnets** plus an S3 gateway endpoint. Allow Fargate tasks to reach AWS APIs without traversing the NAT Gateway.
- **RDS**: PostgreSQL 17 managed database (Terraform default, see `var.postgres_version`), in the **private subnets**. Subnet group + security group ingress restricted to the Central Hub EC2 SG and the `flip-api` ECS task SG.
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring for ECS tasks, the Trust EC2, the WAFv2 ACL, and VPC endpoints. The minimal Central Hub bastion does not run the CloudWatch agent.
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure storage for API secrets and database credentials (`FLIP_API` secret).
- **SSM Parameter Store**: Configuration values read by ECS tasks at startup — bucket URIs, internal service URL, internal-service-key header name.
- **S3 Backend**: Remote state storage with environment-specific buckets, DynamoDB lock table.

### Subnet placement at a glance

| Resource | Subnet | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Gateway | (attached to VPC) | Route target for public subnets |
| NAT Gateway | **Public** | Single shared NAT for all private-subnet egress |
| ALB | **Private** (`internal = true`) | Reached only via the CloudFront VPC origin ENI; SG accepts 443 only from `CloudFront-VPCOrigins-Service-SG` |
| NLB | **Public** | Security group ingress allow-listed to NAT public IP + on-prem Trust IP |
| Central Hub SSM bastion (`aws_instance.ec2_instance`) | **Private** | t3.micro, 10 GB; no inbound rules or app workloads; `psql` + SSM only |
| Trust EC2 (`module.trust_ec2`) | **Private** | No inbound ports; SSM-only |
| ECS Fargate tasks (`flip-api`, `fl-api-net-1`, `fl-server-net-1`) | **Private** | `assign_public_ip = false`, awsvpc ENIs |
| RDS (PostgreSQL) | **Private** | DB subnet group spans both private subnets |
| EFS mount targets | **Private** | One per AZ |
| VPC interface endpoints (Secrets Manager, SSM, Logs, ECR API/DKR) | **Private** | One ENI per AZ |
| S3 gateway endpoint | (routes attached to private route tables) | No ENI |

### Trust Infrastructure

Trust services can run on AWS EC2 or on-premises. Both models use the same Docker Compose stack. Trusts poll the Central Hub for tasks — all communication is outbound from the trust.

**Cloud Trust (AWS EC2)** — deployed using the `trust_ec2` Terraform module:

- Automated Docker and Docker Compose installation
- Trust compose stack deployment via user_data script
- Automatic Docker network creation for inter-service communication
- Runs in a private subnet with no inbound ports — XNAT and Orthanc accessible only via SSM port forwarding for debugging

**On-Premises Trust** — provisioned via `make provision-local-trust` and the Ansible playbook in [`deploy/providers/local/`](../local/README.md):

- Same Docker Compose stack, running on a local Ubuntu host
- No inbound port forwarding or firewall rules needed — all trust communication is outbound

### Port configuration

Ingress at the load balancers (not at any EC2 SG — both EC2 hosts are in private subnets with no inbound rules from the internet). The NLB is the only load balancer reachable directly from the internet; the ALB is internal and only reachable via the CloudFront VPC origin:

| Port | Load balancer | Status | Source allow-list | Purpose |
| ---- | ------------- | ------ | ----------------- | ------- |
| **22** | — | 🔴 **CLOSED everywhere** | n/a | SSH never exposed — remote access is via SSM Session Manager tunnel |
| **443** | ALB (internal) | 🟢 **OPEN to VPC origin only** | `CloudFront-VPCOrigins-Service-SG` | `/api/*` HTTPS traffic from CloudFront via the VPC origin ENI. Not reachable from the internet (ALB has no public IP). Default action returns 404. |
| **80** | ALB (internal) | 🟡 **DEFINED, UNREACHABLE** | (no ingress rule) | Legacy HTTP→HTTPS redirect listener. SG has no port-80 ingress and the ALB has no public IP anyway; CloudFront already redirects HTTP→HTTPS at the edge and dials the origin HTTPS-only. |
| **`FL_SERVER_PORT`** | NLB | 🟡 **CONDITIONAL** | NAT Gateway public IP + `local_trust_public_ip` if set | TCP/gRPC pass-through to the `fl-server-net-1` Fargate task |

Ports referenced internally only (no internet-facing ingress; reached only from inside the VPC or from the load balancers):

- **8000** — `flip-api` ECS task port (ALB target group target port). Not exposed externally.
- **`FL_API_PORT`** — `fl-api-net-1` ECS task port. Cloud Map internal only; no LB and no external ingress.
- **5432** — RDS PostgreSQL. Reachable only from the Central Hub EC2 SG and the `flip-api` ECS task SG.
- **Trust API** — no inbound port needed; trusts poll the hub outbound.

### Remote Access via SSM Session Manager

EC2 instances are accessed through AWS Systems Manager Session Manager — port 22 is **not** open in any security group. SSH traffic is tunnelled through the SSM agent running on each instance, so no bastion host or inbound firewall rule is needed.

**Prerequisites**

- AWS CLI authenticated for the correct account and region:

  ```bash
  export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>   # e.g. stag or prod
  export AWS_REGION=eu-west-2         # must match the region where instances are deployed
  aws sso login --profile $AWS_PROFILE
  ```

- [AWS Session Manager plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) installed (minimum version 1.2.319.0):

  **macOS:**

  ```bash
  brew install session-manager-plugin
  brew upgrade session-manager-plugin  # Update if already installed
  ```

  **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

  ```bash
  curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/ubuntu_64bit/session-manager-plugin.deb" -o "session-manager-plugin.deb"
  sudo dpkg -i session-manager-plugin.deb
  ```

  **Verify installation:**

  ```bash
  session-manager-plugin --version  # Should output version >= 1.2.319.0
  ```

- SSH key at `~/.ssh/host-aws` (configured in Step 3 of [Pre-configurations README](../README.md#step-3-get-ssh-key-configured))

**Updating `~/.ssh/config`**

After `terraform apply`, run:

```bash
make ssh-config
```

This calls `update_ssm_ssh_config.py`, which reads the EC2 instance IDs from Terraform outputs and writes `Host flip` / `Host flip-trust` blocks like the following into `~/.ssh/config`:

```text
# Managed by FLIP - SSH over SSM Session Manager
Host flip
    HostName i-0123456789abcdef0
    User ubuntu
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/host-aws
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
    ProxyCommand aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p' --region eu-west-2 --profile <your-profile>
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-flip-%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist 10m
```

**Connecting**

```bash
ssh flip        # Central Hub SSM bastion
ssh flip-trust  # Trust EC2
```

Both aliases resolve through the SSM tunnel — no public IP or open port 22 is needed. If your AWS session has expired, re-run `aws sso login --profile $AWS_PROFILE` before connecting.

**Troubleshooting SSM Access**

| Problem | Diagnostics | Solution |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| `Unable to locate credentials` | `aws sts get-caller-identity` returns error | Run `aws sso login --profile $AWS_PROFILE` to refresh session |
| `SessionManagerPlugin not found` | `command -v session-manager-plugin` returns nothing | Install plugin: `brew install session-manager-plugin` (macOS) or see prerequisites above |
| `[ERROR] SessionManagerPlugin is not installed` | Session manager plugin is missing or outdated | Upgrade plugin: `brew upgrade session-manager-plugin` or download latest version |
| `InvalidInstanceID.NotFound` | SSH attempts to connect but fails | Verify instance exists: `terraform output Ec2InstanceId` and `terraform output TrustEc2InstanceId` |
| `AccessDeniedException` | `aws ssm start-session` returns access denied | Check EC2 instance IAM role has `ssm:StartSession` and `ec2messages:*` permissions (Terraform should have created this) |
| `Connection timeout` (hanging) | SSM tunnel hangs without error | Check `aws ssm describe-instance-information` reports the instance as `Online`, verify the instance is running, and confirm its private subnet has NAT/VPC-endpoint egress. No inbound SSH rule is required. |
| `Unable to connect to SSM endpoint` | Connection fails immediately | Verify AWS_REGION matches deployment region: `echo $AWS_REGION` should match `eu-west-2` (or your region) |
| `Bad ProxyCommand` in ~/.ssh/config | SSH config syntax error | Re-generate config: `make ssh-config` and verify it looks like the example above |

**Testing Connectivity**

```bash
# Test SSM session directly (before trying SSH)
aws ssm start-session --target $(terraform output -raw Ec2InstanceId)

# Should open an interactive shell. Run `uname -a` to verify connectivity, then `exit`.

# Then test SSH
ssh flip  # Should connect via SSM tunnel
```

## Email Templates

All email templates are stored as standalone HTML files under `templates/`, organised by service. Both Terraform and the Python test utility load from the same files, ensuring a single source of truth.

### Template Structure

```sh
deploy/providers/AWS/
├── templates/
│   ├── cognito/
│   │   ├── invite.html                      # Temporary password invitation
│   │   ├── password_reset_code.html         # Password reset with verification code
│   │   └── password_reset_link.html         # Password reset with direct link
│   └── ses/
│       ├── flip-access-request.html         # Access request notification
│       ├── flip-access-request.txt          # Plain-text fallback
│       ├── flip-xnat-credentials.html       # XNAT credential notification
│       └── flip-xnat-credentials.txt        # Plain-text fallback
├── services.tf                              # Cognito config - loads cognito/ templates via file()
├── main.tf                                  # SES config - loads ses/ templates via file()
└── tests/
    └── test_email_templates.py              # Test utility for all templates
```

### How Templates Are Loaded

**Cognito templates** (services.tf):

```hcl
email_message = file("${path.module}/templates/cognito/invite.html")
```

**SES templates** (main.tf):

```hcl
html = file("${path.module}/templates/ses/flip-access-request.html")
text = file("${path.module}/templates/ses/flip-access-request.txt")
```

Changes to template files are automatically picked up on next `terraform apply` or test run.

### Template Placeholders

**Cognito templates** use single-brace placeholders substituted by AWS Cognito:

| Placeholder | Replaced By | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{username}` | Cognito username (email) | <john.smith@example.com> |
| `{####}` | 6-digit temporary password or verification code | 123456 |
| `{flip_alb_subdomain}` | ALB domain from Terraform var | flip-app.example.com |
| `{reset_link}` | Password reset link with token | <https://flip.../reset?token=xyz> |

**SES templates** use double-brace (Mustache) placeholders substituted at send time:

| Placeholder | Replaced By | Used In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{{name}}` | Requestor's name | access-request |
| `{{email}}` | Requestor's email | access-request |
| `{{purpose}}` | Access request purpose | access-request |
| `{{trust_name}}` | Trust name | xnat-credentials |
| `{{project_name}}` | XNAT project name | xnat-credentials |
| `{{project_id}}` | XNAT project ID | xnat-credentials |
| `{{username}}` | XNAT username | xnat-credentials |
| `{{password}}` | XNAT password | xnat-credentials |

### Quick Local Testing

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS

# Test all templates and generate HTML previews
python3 tests/test_email_templates.py

# View in browser with local HTTP server
python3 tests/test_email_templates.py --serve
# Open http://localhost:8000/flip_email_invite.html

# Test with custom data
python3 tests/test_email_templates.py \
  --username "user@health.org" \
  --subdomain "flip-stag.example.com"
```

The validation script checks:

- HTML structure and syntax
- Placeholder substitution for both Cognito and SES templates
- FLIP branding colors (#61366e, #9452A8)
- Required text elements present
- Generates browser-viewable preview files

### Testing Emails End-to-End

After deploying, test that emails are delivered correctly by using the **Register User** workflow in FLIP. Registering a new user through the platform triggers the Cognito invitation email with the temporary password. This is the simplest way to verify the templates render correctly in a real email client.

### Email Client Compatibility

| Client | Support | Notes |
| -------- | --------- | ------- |
| Gmail Web | Full | CSS gradients supported |
| Outlook Web | Full | CSS gradients with fallback |
| Apple Mail | Full | Dark mode compatible |
| Outlook Desktop | Mostly | Table layout reliable |
| Thunderbird | Full | Standard HTML support |
| Yahoo Mail | Good | Limited CSS support |

For professional cross-client testing: [Litmus](https://www.litmus.com/) or [Email on Acid](https://www.emailonacid.com/)

### SES Prerequisites

Before testing emails:

1. **Verify SES Email** in AWS Console (SES → Configuration → Identities)
2. **Sandbox Mode** (default): can only send to verified email addresses. Request production access in SES console.
3. **Check Send Quota**: `aws ses get-account-sending-enabled --region <aws-region>`

### Troubleshooting Email Issues

| Issue | Solution |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Email gradients don't render | Most clients support gradients; solid color fallback in template |
| Button not clickable | Some clients disable links for security; check email client settings |
| Text wraps awkwardly | Tables use responsive max-width: 600px (standard) |
| Colors wrong in dark mode | Test in both light/dark modes; colors are contrast checked |
| Logo not loading | Verify the image URL is accessible (hosted on GitHub raw content) |
| Email not delivered | Check SES verification status and sandbox mode restrictions |

### Making Template Changes

1. **Edit template file** in `templates/cognito/` or `templates/ses/`
2. **Test locally**: `python3 tests/test_email_templates.py` (verify all 5 pass)
3. **Review**: Check generated `email_previews/*.html` files in browser
4. **Deploy**: Changes are picked up on next `terraform apply`
