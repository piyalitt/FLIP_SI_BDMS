# Deployment Providers

A **provider** provisions the *infrastructure* a FLIP component runs on — an AWS account, an on-prem host, a
Kubernetes cluster. It does not define the container stack itself; that lives in the compose files described
in [`../README.md#where-things-live`](../README.md#where-things-live).

| Provider | Deploys | Entry point |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| [`AWS/`](AWS/README.md) | **Hub + optional cloud trust** — ECS Fargate, RDS + Proxy, ALB/NLB, CloudFront, Cognito, SES, and a trust EC2 host **unless `DEPLOY_TRUST_EC2=false`** (it defaults to `true`, and is settable from the env file as well as the CLI) | `make -C deploy/providers/AWS full-deploy KIT=<CODE> PROD=<stag\|true>`<br>hub-only: `full-deploy-hub-only PROD=<stag\|true>` |
| [`kubernetes/`](kubernetes/README.md) | **Trust only** — Helm chart `flip-trust` | `make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes deploy-trust-k8s KIT=<CODE> PROD=<stag\|true>` |
| [`local/`](local/README.md) | **Trust only** — Ansible provisioning of an on-prem Ubuntu host | `make -C deploy/providers/AWS provision-local-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=<stag\|true>` |

`KIT=<CODE>` names the trust whose kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`) the target reads; `PROD` selects
that file's environment suffix. **The two Makefiles derive the suffix differently, so always spell `PROD`
out:** `deploy/providers/AWS/Makefile`'s `KIT_ENV_SUFFIX` is two-valued — `production` when `PROD=true`,
`stag` otherwise — while `deploy/providers/kubernetes/Makefile`'s `ENV` is three-valued: `production`,
`stag`, and **`development` when `PROD` is unset**.

`KIT` is load-bearing on every row, and omitting it costs a *partial* run rather than a clean failure:

- `provision-local-trust` resolves `FL_KIT_SLOT` out of the kit file and aborts at the FL kit download —
  after the Ansible play has already run.
- `full-deploy` pulls in `deploy-trust` → `seed-trust-data`, whose `KIT is required` guard fires only after
  `plan`, `apply`, `deploy-centralhub` and `register-trusts` have all run. Deploying the hub alone needs no
  `KIT`: use `full-deploy-hub-only`.

## Why two of three are trust-only

Deployment variability is almost entirely trust-side. A **trust** can run on AWS EC2, an on-prem Ubuntu box,
or a Kubernetes cluster — three targets, hence three provider recipes. The **Central Hub** has exactly one
supported production target, AWS ECS Fargate (hub-on-EC2 was deprecated in
[#936](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues/936); `deploy/compose.production.yml` is a local
prod-image harness, not a deploy target). One target needs no abstraction, so there is no hub-only provider.

## AWS is the orchestrator

The three providers are siblings, but the AWS provider drives the other two — it owns the Terraform outputs
(VPC, NLB security-group rules, FL participant kits in S3) that an on-prem or K8s trust needs in order to
reach the hub:

- `make -C deploy/providers/AWS provision-local-trust` runs `local/site_local_trust.yml`
- `make -C deploy/providers/AWS full-deploy-with-k8s` calls `$(MAKE) -C ../kubernetes sync-kit / up / status`

So a trust-only provider is not hub-independent: whichever one you use, the trust is still registered on the
hub (`make register-trust KIT=<CODE>`) and still receives its kit file from the hub admin.

## Note on the AWS Terraform root

`AWS/` is a **single Terraform root with a single state file** (`backend.tf` → `key = "flip/terraform.tfstate"`).
The cloud trust is instantiated from that same root (`AWS/main.tf`, `module "trust_ec2"`) and consumes
hub-owned resources — the hub's VPC subnets, security group, key pair and IAM instance profile. The cloud
trust runs *inside the hub's VPC*. It is therefore not separable into hub and trust halves without splitting
Terraform state; treat `AWS/` as one indivisible unit.
