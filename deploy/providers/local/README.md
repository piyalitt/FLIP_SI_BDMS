# FLIP Local (On-Premises) Trust Deployment

> **Deploys: trust only.** This playbook provisions the *host*; the trust container stack itself comes from
> [`trust/deploy/`](../../../trust/deploy/README.md). The AWS provider must already be deployed — this
> playbook depends on its Terraform outputs, the FL participant kits in S3, and the hub NLB security-group
> rules. See [`../README.md`](../README.md) for how this provider relates to the other two.

Ansible playbook and supporting files to provision an on-premises Ubuntu host as a FLIP Trust node. The provisioned host polls the Central Hub (running in AWS) for tasks — all communication is outbound from the trust.

This is the **local provider** counterpart to the [AWS provider](../AWS/README.md), which manages the Central Hub and
(optionally) cloud-hosted Trust instances. Together they implement the
[hybrid deployment model](../../../docs/source/deploy-flip.rst).

  Trusts poll the hub (outbound only)
```

Each local Trust host runs:

| Service | Container port | Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| trust-api | 8000 | HTTP (polls hub outbound) |
| imaging-api | 8000 | HTTP (internal) |
| data-access-api | 8000 | HTTP (internal) |
| fl-client | — | TCP (connects outbound to FL server via NLB) |

The on-prem trust kit (`trust/.env.<CODE>.production`) can default `IMAGING_API_PORT` / `DATA_ACCESS_API_PORT` / `TRUST_API_PORT` to host ports shifted off the first dev trust's allocation (`8005` / `8014` / `8024` vs the dev `8001` / `8010` / `8020`), so the prod-pointed stack coexists on a developer laptop with `make up` (whose first dev trust binds the original ports via `trust/deploy/compose_trust-1_override.yml`). A real on-prem operator on a dedicated host can revert the kit-file values to standard `8001` / `8010` / `8020` if their tooling expects them.

## Prerequisites

1. **Operator workstation** — The machine where you run the commands (typically your laptop). It needs:
   - Python 3.12+ and [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/)
   - Ansible (installed via `uv sync` in `deploy/providers/AWS/`)
   - Terraform outputs available (you must have run `make init` + `make apply` in `deploy/providers/AWS/` first)
   - SSH access to the trust host (if provisioning remotely)

2. **Trust host** — An Ubuntu 22.04+ machine (physical or VM) with:
   - A user account with `sudo` privileges (default: `ubuntu`)
   - SSH access from the operator workstation (if remote), or local access
   - Internet connectivity (to pull Docker images and packages)

3. **AWS Central Hub deployed** — The Central Hub must be running in AWS (required for Terraform outputs, FL participant kits in S3, and NLB security group configuration). See [`deploy/providers/AWS/`](../AWS/README.md).

## Quick Start

All commands are run from the `deploy/providers/AWS/` directory since the Makefile targets there orchestrate both cloud and local infrastructure:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
```

### Recommended end-to-end target (hybrid)

```bash
make full-deploy-hybrid PROD=<stag|true> [LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip>]
```

This wrapper target runs the full AWS + on-prem trust provisioning pipeline and registers the trust on the running hub (`make register-trusts`) — inserting the `trust` row with its `api_key_hash`, claiming an FL kit slot, and writing the per-trust kit file. No hub redeploy is needed. `PROD` is inherited from the environment and supports both staging (`stag`) and production (`true`). Omit `LOCAL_TRUST_IP` to auto-detect the operator machine's public IP.

You still need to start the on-prem trust stack on the trust host. The playbook
deliberately does **not** add the SSH login user to the `docker` group (docker
group membership is equivalent to root on the host — any member can mount `/`
into a container and chroot in), so docker commands and `make -C trust up-trust`
must be run via `sudo`:

```bash
cd ../../..
sudo -E env PROD=<stag|true> make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE>
```

Use the trust code you registered, whose kit file is `trust/.env.<CODE>.production`.
`-E` is load-bearing: it preserves `$HOME`, so root's docker client reuses your
`~/.docker/config.json` GHCR login for the image pulls — a plain `sudo` looks in
`/root/.docker` and the pulls fail. (`PROD` needs no preserving; `env PROD=…` sets
it explicitly for the command.) Any direct `docker`, `docker compose`, or
`docker swarm` invocations on the trust host should likewise be prefixed with `sudo`.

> **Hosts provisioned before this change are not remediated by re-running the
> playbook.** `geerlingguy.docker`'s `docker_users` is additive — it only ever
> adds to the `docker` group, never removes — so dropping the setting stops *new*
> grants but leaves membership a host already picked up in place. Affected hosts
> (the `Trust_2`/BDMS on-prem host among them) are remediated by the planned
> trust reprovisioning, which rebuilds them from this playbook. To close the gap
> sooner on a host that is already up, evict the user directly and have them log
> back in for it to take effect:
>
> ```bash
> sudo gpasswd -d <login-user> docker   # verify with: id -nG <login-user>
> ```

### Provision the trust host

Run this **on the trust host** — there is no SSH path. The target lives in the
AWS provider Makefile (which orchestrates both cloud and local infrastructure),
so run it from `deploy/providers/AWS/`:

```bash
# Set the sudo password (fish shell; bash: read -rsp ... && export ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS)
set -x ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS (read -s -P 'Sudo password: ')

cd deploy/providers/AWS       # first time only, if you didn't `cd` earlier
make provision-local-trust
```

### What `provision-local-trust` does

1. Runs the Ansible playbook (`site_local_trust.yml`) which:
   - Installs Docker and required system packages
   - Creates application directories under `/opt/flip/`
2. Downloads the FL participant kit from S3 and stages it under `/tmp`, printing the `sudo rsync` commands to deploy it into `${FL_KIT_DIR}/net-1/...` (default `/opt/flip/fl-kit/net-1/...`).

Opening the AWS FL-server NLB to the trust's public IP is a **separate** step — `make allow-local-trust-nlb LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip>` — run by the FLIP admin once the operator reports their IP.

### Post-provisioning manual steps

1. **Start the trust stack** on the trust host. The login user is intentionally
   **not** in the `docker` group (see the security note in the recommended
   end-to-end target above), so use `sudo`:

   ```bash
   cd ../../..
   sudo -E env PROD=stag make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE>   # the trust code you registered
   ```

2. **Verify** the trust can poll the hub (check trust-api logs for successful task polling — `sudo docker compose logs trust-api`).

## Communication Model

Trusts poll the Central Hub for tasks over HTTPS — all communication is **outbound from the trust**. The hub never makes inbound requests to trusts. This simplifies networking: no inbound firewall rules or NAT port-forwarding are needed for the trust API or FL ports.

## Trust Authentication

Any machine with the correct credentials can act as a trust — the hub identifies trusts by API key, not by IP address or hostname. The trust's `.env` file must have:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TRUST_API_KEY` | Per-trust secret key, from the trust's kit file written by `make register-trusts` |
| `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` | Hub URL the trust polls (e.g. `https://app.flip.aicentre.co.uk`) |
| `AES_KEY_BASE64` | Shared encryption key for trust-hub payloads |

**Hub-side prerequisites** (before the trust can connect):

1. The trust must be registered on the hub — run `make register-trusts`, or use the Add-Trust button on the Connection status page. Registration inserts the `trust` row with its `api_key_hash` and claims an FL kit slot. No hub redeploy is needed.

The `full-deploy-with-local-trust` / `full-deploy-hybrid` targets handle trust registration automatically (both honour `PROD=stag|true`). When provisioning a trust standalone with `provision-local-trust`, the trust must already be registered.

## Ansible Playbook Details

### `site_local_trust.yml`

The main playbook. It can be run standalone or via the `provision-local-trust` Makefile target.

**Optional variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flip_dir` | `/opt/flip` | Root application directory |

**Direct usage** (without the Makefile):

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
uv run ansible-galaxy install -r ../../../deploy/providers/local/requirements.yml

uv run ansible-playbook \
  -i <trust-host-ip>, \
  -u ubuntu \
  --private-key ~/.ssh/trust_key \
  ../../../deploy/providers/local/site_local_trust.yml
```

### `requirements.yml`

Ansible Galaxy dependencies:

- `geerlingguy.docker` — Docker installation role

Install with:

```bash
uv run ansible-galaxy install -r deploy/providers/local/requirements.yml
```

## Home Network Firewall Configuration

### Port Forwarding (NAT)

**No inbound port forwarding is needed.** Trusts poll the hub outbound for tasks, and FL clients connect outbound to the FL server via the NLB. All communication is trust-initiated.

The host/network firewall must allow outbound to **two separate Central Hub hosts** (different load balancers — both must be allowlisted):

- **`app.flip.aicentre.co.uk`** — the ALB (HTTPS API, port 443).
- **`fl.app.flip.aicentre.co.uk`** — the NLB (FL gRPC, default port 8002).

### Dynamic Public IP

The NLB security group allowlists the trust's public IP for FL traffic. If the public IP changes (common with residential broadband), update it. Set `LOCAL_TRUST_PUBLIC_IPS` (an HCL list of every allowlisted IP) in the env file and reconcile with `allow-local-trust-nlb`:

```bash
LOCAL_TRUST_PUBLIC_IPS='["<new-ip>"]' make -C deploy/providers/AWS allow-local-trust-nlb LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<new-ip>
```

Re-running with an already-listed IP is a no-op (idempotent).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Trust not polling hub | Trust stack running? (`sudo docker ps` on trust host). Check trust-api logs for polling errors. |
| `Connection timed out` (FL) | Trust's public IP changed? Update NLB security group. Host/router firewall blocking outbound on port 8002? |
| Firewall blocking outbound | Check host/router firewall allows outbound HTTPS (443) and gRPC (8002) |
| Ansible `Permission denied` | SSH key correct? User has sudo? `ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS` set for local mode? |
