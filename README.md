# Federated Learning Interoperability Platform

FLIP is an open-source platform for federated training and evaluation of medical-imaging AI models across healthcare
institutions. Models travel to the data held inside each institution; patient data remains within the institution's
security boundary.

The platform combines a Central Hub for project orchestration with independently operated Trust nodes. It supports
both [NVIDIA FLARE](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/) and [Flower](https://flower.ai/docs/) as federated-learning
backends. FLIP is developed by the [London AI Centre](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/) with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS
Foundation Trust and King's College London.

For the platform architecture, workflows, deployment guides, and user documentation, start with the
[FLIP documentation](https://londonaicentreflip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Quickstart: Central Hub with two example Trusts

This developer quickstart starts the Central Hub and the shipped GSTT and KCH example Trust nodes on one Linux host.
It uses the development AWS resources and XNAT artifacts maintained for authorised FLIP developers. If you do not
have access to those resources, begin with the
[Central Hub deployment guide](https://londonaicentreflip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy-flip/deploy-central-hub.html) to create your
own environment.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine with Compose and Swarm mode, plus the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on GPU hosts
- GNU Make, `jq`, the AWS CLI, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- An AWS SSO profile with access to the development Cognito, S3, and SES resources
- GitHub Container Registry access for the published FLIP images

The complete tool list and environment-variable checklist are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#prerequisites).

### Start the platform

```bash
cp .env.development.example .env.development
# Fill the required AWS, Cognito, SES, database, encryption, and S3 values.

aws sso login --profile <your-profile>
docker login ghcr.io

# Required once per Docker host.
docker swarm init

# Provision the two local NVFLARE networks used by the example Trusts. `make up` does not do
# this for you, and the FL containers cannot start without it.
make -C fl-services/nvflare provision-2-nets

# Pull the published service images, start the hub, register GSTT and KCH,
# then start both Trust and XNAT stacks.
make up
```

If Swarm is already active, `docker swarm init` reports that and can be skipped. Open `https://localhost` for the UI
and `http://localhost:8080/docs` for the Central Hub API documentation.

To run the scripted project lifecycle against the running stack:

```bash
make e2e_smoke
```

This creates a project, submits a cohort query, waits for imaging import, runs federated training, and downloads the
result. It is intentionally not part of CI and can take several minutes.

Stop the local platform with:

```bash
make down
```

The default backend is NVFLARE. To run the same topology with Flower, provision its per-net credentials instead —
once per network, and again before `make up`:

```bash
make -C fl-services/flower provision NET_NUMBER=1
make -C fl-services/flower provision NET_NUMBER=2
make up FL_BACKEND=flower
```

See the [Flower service guide](fl-services/flower/README.md) for the full workflow. Use `make up BUILD=true` when
dependency or Dockerfile changes require locally rebuilt images; ordinary source edits are bind-mounted for live
reload. More detail is in [Running the stack](CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-stack-pull-vs-build).
