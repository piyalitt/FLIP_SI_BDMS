# CLAUDE.md — FLIP

## Re-read the user prompt (user standing instruction)

YOU MUST READ MY PROMPT AGAIN AND CHECK ALL THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY GET WHAT I WANT IN THE PROMPT.

Before planning, before the first tool call, and again before you finish:
1. Re-read the current user prompt in full. Do not rely on a remembered summary.
2. Check every requirement, constraint, example, exclusion, path, format, and success criterion the prompt actually contains.
3. Confirm the work matches that list with nothing missing, substituted, or silently dropped. If anything is still unclear or blocked, ask once for that blocker only.

## Project Overview

FLIP (Federated Learning Interoperability Platform) — open-source platform for federated training and evaluation of
medical imaging AI models across healthcare institutions while preserving data privacy.

The `flip-utils/`, `fl-services/`, `fl-apps/`, and `fl-tutorials/` trees hold the FL base library, Docker services,
app templates, and tutorials for both NVFLARE and Flower. Both
backends are also provisioned in-tree (gitignored): `deploy/fl_backend.mk` points `FL_PROVISIONED_DIR` per-backend at
`fl-services/nvflare/provision/workspace-dev` (nvflare) or `fl-services/flower/provision/creds` (flower) — see
[`fl-services/nvflare/README.md`](fl-services/nvflare/README.md) and

## Common Commands

### Running Services

```bash
make up                    # Start all services (requires AWS access) — pulls images from GHCR
make up BUILD=true         # Same, but rebuild repo-built services from local source instead of pulling
make up-no-trust           # Start central hub only
make up-trusts             # Start trust services only
make down                  # Stop all services
make restart               # Stop and restart all
make build                 # Build all Docker images (standalone, --no-cache; does not start)
make lock                  # Regenerate every uv.lock from its pyproject.toml
make ui                    # Start UI only
make clean                 # Remove all stopped containers, networks, and images
make ci                    # Run CI pipeline locally using act
make central-hub           # Start flip-api + database (no UI)
make debug SERVICE=<name>  # Restart service in debug mode (port 5678)
make debug-off SERVICE=<name>
make debug-all             # Debug all API services
make debug-off-all         # Remove all debug modes
```

#### Dev image sourcing: pull-by-default

In development (`PROD` unset), `make up` **pulls** the repo-built services
(`flip-api`, `trust-api`, `imaging-api`, `data-access-api`, `orthanc`) from GHCR
rather than building them — they carry `image:` + `pull_policy: always` in the dev
compose, with local `src/` bind-mounted on top so live reload still runs your
working copy. Pass `BUILD=true` (e.g. `make up BUILD=true`) to rebuild from source
instead — required after a dependency (`uv.lock`/`pyproject.toml`) or Dockerfile
change, since those live in the image layer, not the mounted `src/`.

- **Prerequisite:** be logged into GHCR (`docker login ghcr.io`) and have the
  `${DOCKER_TAG}` tag published (dev defaults to `:stag`, the `develop` build).
  A failed pull no longer silently falls back to a build.
- **`flip-ui` is the exception** — it has no published GHCR image, so it always
  builds locally. `make build` remains the standalone `--no-cache` builder.
- Stag/prod are unchanged: `PROD=stag|true` selects the prod compose (baked
  `image:`-only services, no mounts).

### Testing

```bash
make unit_test             # All unit tests across all services (from root)
make integration_test      # flip-api + trust integration tests (from root)
make tests                 # flip-ui unit + e2e tests, then flip-api test suite (from root)
make -C fl-tutorials test  # ruff over fl-tutorials/ + the CPU-only transform-chain suite (no GPU/dataset/FL image)
make e2e_smoke             # End-to-end smoke against a running stack (see below)
# From a service directory (e.g., flip-api/):
make test                  # ruff + mypy + pytest (unit + integration)
make unit_test             # Unit tests only
make integration_test      # Integration tests only (also available from root and trust/)
make local_test            # Tests without Docker
```

### End-to-End Smoke Test

`make e2e_smoke` (from root) drives a full project lifecycle against an **already-running stack**: create project → submit cohort query → wait for image pull → run FL training → download results. It is the scripted form of the manual UI sanity-check and is **not run in CI**. Long-running (image pull + FL training) — run it in the background.

Prerequisites:
- Stack up via `make up` (central hub + trusts + XNAT) with trusts registered; Orthanc PACS seeded with DICOM data so image pull has something to pull.
- The tutorial files are in-tree at `fl-tutorials/<backend>/` (NVFLARE and Flower both migrated from the legacy fl-base repos).

Defaults track `FL_BACKEND` (default `nvflare`): `MODEL_FILES_DIR` and `QUERY_FILE` point at `fl-tutorials/nvflare/image_classification/xray_classification/`. For Flower, they point at the in-tree `fl-tutorials/flower/xray_classification/`. Common overrides:

```bash
make e2e_smoke FL_BACKEND=flower                               # use the Flower tutorial
make e2e_smoke MODEL_FILES_DIR=/path/app QUERY_FILE=/path/q.sql
make e2e_smoke EXTRA_ARGS="--abort-midway"                     # exercise the FL stop-training path
make e2e_smoke EXTRA_ARGS="--image-pull-threshold 0.5 --image-pull-timeout 1200"
make e2e_smoke EXTRA_ARGS="--project-id <UUID>"               # reuse an approved project (see below)
make e2e_smoke EXTRA_ARGS="--trusts GSTT"                     # subset of trusts (codes/names, comma-separated);
                                                              # a registered-but-offline trust no longer blocks the run
```

The `--project-id <UUID>` override (printed as `project_id=<UUID>` at the start of any run) reuses an
existing approved project: it skips cohort submission + approval and jumps straight to model
create → upload → train → download. The image-pull wait still runs but returns immediately when the
studies are already pulled — so it lets you iterate on training/app code (and re-run after an upload
or fl-api change) without re-creating the project and re-pulling DICOM (~6 min/backend) each time.

**Smoking the spleen segmentation app requires a data-enrichment step (it needs labels).** *Data enrichment*
is the platform stage where a model developer adds whatever an app needs on top of the pulled imaging data in
XNAT (`docs/source/user-guides/user-data-enrichment.rst` — a project cannot start training until enrichment is
confirmed complete, even when nothing was added).

**Which supervised apps need it:** only those whose labels are **not in OMOP**. A segmentation mask is a 3D
volume with nowhere to live in the cohort query, so the spleen apps
(`fl-tutorials/<backend>/3d_spleen_segmentation*`) pair each converted `input_*.nii.gz` with a sibling
`label_*.nii.gz` that has to be uploaded to XNAT. The xray classification tutorial is the counter-example: its
labels *are* in OMOP, projected as dataframe columns by `query.sql` (`image_feature` → `observation`), and it
needs no enrichment. Skip a required enrichment and the smoke pulls, converts, starts training and then fails
with `No image/label pairs found: N image(s) …, none with a matching label_*.nii.gz` — which names the actual
cause. (Older app copies die with torch's opaque `num_samples=0` instead.)

`e2e_smoke` has a hook for exactly this: `--data-enrichment-cwd` + `--data-enrichment-cmd` run a shell command
**between the image pull and training**, with `FLIP_PROJECT_ID` exported. Since FLIP#776 the spleen uploader is
in-tree at `fl-tutorials/nvflare/image_segmentation/3d_spleen_segmentation/utils/upload_spleen_labels_to_xnat.py`
— **no private repo required**. It resolves each trust's XNAT project by `secondary_ID == <FLIP project_id>`,
fetches the accession→MSD-case mapping at run time from the public `aicentreflip/trust-data` dataset
(`omop-csv/<version>/spleen_project/image_occurrence.csv`, which also carries `source_trust`), and writes each
label into the scan's existing `NIFTI` resource, renaming `input_` → `label_`. The XNAT protocol work lives in
`flip.xnat` (`flip-utils/flip/xnat/`), also exposed as the `flip-xnat` CLI.

**Enrich every trust, not one.** Each trust's XNAT holds only its own studies, so a trust left without
labels takes the run down at the zero-pairs guard. One invocation covers the roster: pass a
space-separated `XNAT_URLS` (credentials from `XNAT_USER`/`XNAT_PASS`) or repeat `XNAT_CREDENTIALS_FILES`
for per-trust logins. The whole mapping goes to every server and each ignores the others' studies, so no
per-trust splitting is needed. A run that resolves **no** destination anywhere now exits non-zero, so the
smoke can no longer walk past a wholly-skipped enrichment into a doomed training run (`--allow-no-op`
opts out). `TRUST=N` filters by the OMOP `source_trust` column (1=GSTT, 2=KCH) and is rarely needed —
note that is the OMOP partition, **not** the FL kit slot of the same `Trust_N` name.

Prereqs: `make -C fl-tutorials download-spleen-data NUM_CASES=41` (a smaller download enriches only part
of the cohort — the command warns, naming the missing cases) and `XNAT_USER`/`XNAT_PASS`. Standalone,
outside the smoke:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials upload-spleen-labels FLIP_PROJECT_ID=<uuid> \
  XNAT_URLS="http://127.0.0.1:8104 http://127.0.0.1:8106" DRY_RUN=1   # then drop DRY_RUN
```

The mapping is cached beside the labels dir (so a re-run needs no huggingface.co egress) and
`HF_TRUST_DATA_REVISION=<sha>` pins the dataset revision instead of the moving `main`.

Through the smoke, `make -C flip-api e2e_smoke_spleen` (or `e2e_smoke_spleen_evaluation`) carries the
in-tree command already, targeting both dev trusts via `SPLEEN_XNAT_URLS` (override for another roster;
`SPLEEN_LABELS_DIR` likewise). The enrichment flags ride in `ENRICHMENT_ARGS`, deliberately *not*
`EXTRA_ARGS` — a command-line variable beats a target-specific one, so folding them together made
`make e2e_smoke_spleen EXTRA_ARGS="--project-id <uuid>"` silently skip enrichment. To invoke it directly
instead:

```bash
cd flip-api && uv run python -m tests.e2e_smoke \
  --model-files-dir ../fl-tutorials/nvflare/image_segmentation/3d_spleen_segmentation/app_files \
  --query-file ../fl-tutorials/nvflare/image_segmentation/3d_spleen_segmentation/query.sql \
  --data-enrichment-cwd ../fl-tutorials/nvflare/image_segmentation/3d_spleen_segmentation \
  --data-enrichment-cmd 'uv run --no-project --with ../../../../flip-utils python utils/upload_spleen_labels_to_xnat.py --flip-project-id "$FLIP_PROJECT_ID" --labels-dir ../../data/spleen/images --xnat-url http://127.0.0.1:8104 --xnat-url http://127.0.0.1:8106'
```

(The `$`-escaping trap still applies to any hand-written `EXTRA_ARGS`: `make -C flip-api …` expands once, so
`$$FLIP_PROJECT_ID` survives; the **root** `make e2e_smoke` re-expands through a second make and shell, so no
`$`-escape survives it — `$$` lands empty and `$$$$` injects the recipe shell's PID. Pass the id literally
there. The in-Makefile targets handle this for you. Note that `e2e_smoke_spleen` uploads the **Flower**
tutorial (`../fl-tutorials/flower/3d_spleen_segmentation/{app,query.sql}`), not the NVFLARE paths shown in the
direct-invocation example above — pair it with `FL_BACKEND=flower`, or invoke `tests.e2e_smoke` directly with
the NVFLARE paths for the NVFLARE tutorial. The enrichment step itself is backend-agnostic and runs out of the
NVFLARE tree either way.)

Enrichment must land **after** the pull and after DICOM→NIfTI conversion; the hook's position guarantees that.
The uploader derives each target filename from the converted `input_*.nii.gz`, so with no `NIFTI` resource it
skips every scan (reported as *skipped (no image in resource)*) — i.e. a broken XNAT Container Service surfaces
as "no labels".

**Testing a change on BOTH FL backends in one sitting (the backend switch).** The pulled DICOM lives in
each trust's Orthanc/XNAT, which `make restart-fl` leaves untouched — so you can pull once on the first
backend and *reuse the same project* for the second, skipping the second image pull entirely:

```bash
# 0. Rebuild the fl-api image(s) from your branch first — the running stack serves PUBLISHED images,
#    not your code. Full: `make build-fl FL_BACKEND=<backend>`; fl-api-only fast path:
#    DOCKER_GID=$(id -g) docker compose -f fl-services/<backend>/compose.dev.yml build <fl-api|flip-fl-api>
make e2e_smoke FL_BACKEND=flower                                          # note the printed project_id=<UUID>
make restart-fl FL_BACKEND=nvflare DOCKER_FL_REGISTRY= DOCKER_FL_TAG=dev  # switch backend onto rebuilt :dev images
make e2e_smoke FL_BACKEND=nvflare EXTRA_ARGS="--project-id <UUID>"        # reuse project → skip cohort + re-pull
```

Before trusting either run, confirm the live container actually carries your code (the stack silently
runs old images otherwise): `docker exec flip-fl-api-net-1 cat fl_api/utils/upload.py`. See
[Running FL Tutorials Locally](#running-fl-tutorials-locally) for `make build-fl` / `:dev` image details.

### Running FL Tutorials Locally

The NVFLARE tutorials live in `fl-tutorials/` and are all **Client-API** apps (the legacy Executor
tutorials, templates and their Docker `testing/` harness are removed; the pre-rename `*_client_api`
job-type names survive only as accepted aliases for models created before the rename). Each tutorial carries a `.env.app` and a `job.py` driving a FLIP recipe;
`make run` delegates to `make sim`, which runs the NVFLARE simulator (SimEnv) in the flip-utils venv
with the `full` ML extra (needs a GPU; per-tutorial `make export` builds the full job config with no
GPU). From the repo root:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials list-tutorials
make -C fl-tutorials download-xray-data                  # xray dataset (HF); spleen: download-spleen-data
make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=xray_classification
make -C fl-tutorials run-all-tutorials                   # every tutorial (heavy; stops on first failure)
```

To iterate on the FL images, `make build-fl` builds them locally as `:dev` (see `fl-services/nvflare/README.md`);
run the stack on them with `make up DOCKER_FL_REGISTRY= DOCKER_FL_TAG=dev`.

### Linting & Type Checking

```bash
uv run ruff check . --fix  # Lint with auto-fix
uv run mypy .              # Static type checking
```

### Debugging

```bash
make debug SERVICE=flip-api        # Start a service in debug mode
make debug SERVICE=trust-api       # Available: flip-api, trust-api, imaging-api, data-access-api
make debug-off SERVICE=flip-api    # Stop debug mode
```

### Test Data

```bash
make -C flip-api create_testing_projects   # Create test projects
make -C flip-api delete_testing_projects   # Clean up test data
make seed-demo-projects                    # Curated radiology catalogue in honest lifecycle states
                                           # (EXTRA_ARGS="--cleanup" removes it again)
```

### Demo Video Recorder

`make demo-video` records the full end-to-end walkthrough (researcher creates project + cohort → admin checks
Connection Status, stages + approves → XNAT/OHIF DICOM view at a trust → model + app upload → training → results
download) against the **live dev stack** and assembles one mp4. Local dev tool, not run in CI. Six Cypress segments
(`flip-ui/test/cypress/demo/`, config `flip-ui/cypress.demo.config.ts` — a live-wired fork of the docs-GIF harness
with a `demoCaption` subtitle verb) run in Docker (`cypress/included`, `--network host`); the slow platform waits
(cohort responses, ~6 min imaging import, FL training) happen **off-camera** between segments via
`flip-api/tests/demo_video.py`, which reuses `tests/e2e_smoke.py`'s wait functions and finally calls
`flip-ui/scripts/assemble-demo-video.sh` (same crop constants as `videos-to-gifs.sh`). Prerequisites: stack up,
live AWS SSO session, and ideally the demo Cognito users — `make demo-users` (reads `DEMO_RESEARCHER_PASSWORD` /
`DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from env, never committed) then restart flip-api so seeding grants their roles; without them
the recorder falls back to the well-known admin for both parts. Useful `DEMO_ARGS`: `--app spleen` (record the 3D
spleen segmentation tutorial instead of chest X-ray; pair with `--data-enrichment-cwd/-cmd` for the off-camera
label upload, same contract as `e2e_smoke`), `--publish-segmentations` (republish those NIfTI labels as DICOM-SEG
ROI collections via `flip-api/tests/xnat_seg_upload.py` so segment 3 shows the segmentation overlaid in OHIF —
dcmqi in Docker for the conversion, the viewer's own `PUT /xapi/roi/…?type=SEG` for the upload; `--seg-limit`
caps how many sessions per trust are converted), `--skip-xnat`, `--project-id <uuid> --from-segment <n>` (iterate
on later segments without re-running the pull), `--trusts GSTT`, `--fl-backend flower`, `--video-scale 1` (fast
drafts; the default 3 renders the browser at 3× device pixels so the 1280x800 viewport is captured at 3840x2400 —
4K-class). Segment mp4s + the final video land under `flip-ui/test/cypress/demo/` (gitignored). The final mp4 is
named for the recorded app (`flip-demo-xray.mp4` / `flip-demo-spleen.mp4`).

### Database migrations (flip-api)

flip-api's PostgreSQL schema is owned by **Alembic** (`flip-api/src/flip_api/db/migrations/`), not `SQLModel.metadata.create_all`. The flip-api entrypoint runs `alembic upgrade head` before seeding at boot (fail-fast). Any schema-affecting change to `flip-api/src/flip_api/db/models/*.py` **must** ship a revision in the same PR — the integration drift guard (`flip-api/tests/integration/test_migrations.py`) fails otherwise.

```bash
make -C flip-api migration MESSAGE="..."   # autogenerate a revision (flip-db must be up); then review it
make -C flip-api migrate                   # alembic upgrade head
make -C flip-api migration_current         # show current revision
```

### Docker Swarm Commands

```bash
docker swarm init                          # Initialize Swarm mode
docker network rm deploy_trust-network-1   # Remove trust network
docker network rm deploy_trust-network-2   # Remove trust network
make create-networks                       # Create all networks
docker compose -f deploy/compose.development.yml exec <service> <command>
docker compose -f deploy/compose.development.yml run --rm <service>
```

### Trust Registration & Key Setup

```bash
make new-trust TRUST_CODE=<CODE> TRUST_NAME="..."  # Scaffold trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>
make register-trusts                  # Register the shipped dev roster (trust/.env.*.development.example)
make register-trust KIT=<CODE>        # Register one trust + fill its kit (creds + hub-shared block)
make sync-trust-kit KIT=<CODE> PROD=<env>  # Rotation only: refresh hub-shared values in trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>
make sync-trust-kits                  # Refresh every locally-present kit file
make generate-internal-service-key    # Generate fl-server-to-hub key
```

## Workflow Requirements

### Always Use Make Commands

When a Makefile target exists, always use it instead of raw commands. Make targets encapsulate correct flags, environment setup, and command sequences:

- `make test` instead of raw ruff + mypy + pytest
- `make build` instead of raw docker compose build
- `make up`/`make down` instead of raw docker compose

### Always Verify Changes

After code changes, run verification before committing:

1. Identify affected services.
2. Run service-level test: `make test` (or `make unit_test` if no Docker).
3. For cross-service changes, run root-level: `make unit_test`.
4. For frontend changes: `cd flip-ui && npm run lint && npm run test:unit`
5. Fix all failures before committing.

### Documentation Check

After changes, evaluate if docs need updating:

| Change Type | Documentation to Review |
|-------------|------------------------|
| New service/component | `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/source/components.rst` |
| New API endpoints | `docs/source/api-reference.rst`, service `README.md` |
| Changed env vars | `.env.development.example`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/source/sys-admin.rst` |
| New dependencies | `CONTRIBUTING.md`, service `README.md` |
| Changed deployment config | `deploy/README.md`, `docs/source/sys-admin.rst` |
| New Make targets | `CONTRIBUTING.md`, this file |
| User-facing workflow changes | `docs/source/user-guides.rst` |
| FL framework features | `docs/source/components/component-fl-nodes.rst` |
| Trust service changes | `trust/README.md`, relevant `trust/*/README.md` |
| Auth/role changes | `docs/source/sys-admin/admin-user-roles.rst` |
| Agent instructions (this file's `CLAUDE`/`AGENTS` pair, at any level) | Both members of the pair, in the same PR: every `CLAUDE`-named instructions file has an `AGENTS`-named mirror in the same directory — an exact copy with only the file name substituted (title + cross-references). Edit the `CLAUDE`-named file, then regenerate its twin from it with `sed 's/CLAUDE\.md/AGENTS.md/g'`; never edit the `AGENTS`-named twin directly. |

## Code Style & Conventions

### Python

- Line length: 120. Linter: Ruff (`select = ['I', 'F', 'E', 'W', 'PT', 'UP006', 'UP007', 'UP035', 'UP042', 'UP045']`; `UP042` enforces `StrEnum` over the legacy `(str, Enum)` pattern). Type checker: mypy.
- Docstrings: Google style. Naming: snake_case. Imports: alphabetically sorted.
- Source layout: `src/[service_name]/`. Tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`.
- Test placement: a test goes in `tests/integration/` if and only if it touches a real backing service (Postgres via `session` fixture, real AWS, a running sibling API, real Orthanc/XNAT/OMOP). If every external dependency is mocked, it's a unit test in `tests/unit/`. FastAPI `TestClient` alone does not make a test "integration". Tests for the tutorial tree live outside any service, in `fl-tutorials/tests/` — CPU-only, running in flip-utils' env (`flip-utils[full]`), with fixtures synthesised in-process; anything needing real training stays with the GPU simulator harness. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` ("Where does my test go?") for the canonical rule.
- Dependency injection: FastAPI `Depends()`. DB: sync SQLModel `Session` via `get_session()` — the `with Session(...)` block is load-bearing on error paths (FLIP#773). Prod authenticates through RDS Proxy with a per-connection IAM token (SQLAlchemy `do_connect` hook, passwordless engine URL).

6. `make create-networks`

### Key Environment Variables

- `FL_BACKEND` — `nvflare` (default) or `flower`. Two roles: (1) deploy layer — selects which fl-* images run (compose/Makefile); (2) flip-api — sets the `FLNets.fl_backend` column at seed time. The seeded value is **canonical**: flip-api reads `FL_BACKEND` only at seeding and never reconciles it at runtime. To switch frameworks, `make restart-fl FL_BACKEND=...` recreates flip-api so its startup seeding re-applies the backend onto every net.
- `FL_PROVISIONED_DIR` — path to the in-tree provisioned FL artifacts, derived per-backend by `deploy/fl_backend.mk` from `FL_BACKEND`: `fl-services/nvflare/provision/workspace-dev` (nvflare startup kits) or `fl-services/flower/provision/creds` (flower per-net TLS certs + SuperNode keys). Both gitignored. Read only by the dev compose overlays for the cert/workspace volume mounts; override at the CLI for a one-off (`make up FL_PROVISIONED_DIR=...`). FL Makefiles are **per-backend** — each `fl-services/<backend>/Makefile` owns that backend's `build`/`provision`/`up`/`down`/`submit` (flower also `up-secure`); the root Makefile forwards only `build-fl` by `FL_BACKEND`. Each backend's `fl-services/<backend>/Makefile` also owns its network provisioning (NVFLARE adds `provision`/`provision-2-nets`/`provision-stag`/`provision-prod`/`upload-kits-to-s3`; the project YAMLs, `scripts/`, and gitignored `workspace-{dev,stag,prod}/` output live under `provision/`). Provision with `make -C fl-services/nvflare provision-2-nets` (nvflare) or `make -C fl-services/flower provision NET_NUMBER=<N>` (flower). To run a backend standalone + submit without the full stack: `make -C fl-services/<backend> up` (or `up-secure`) then `make -C fl-services/<backend> submit APP=<job>`.
- `FL_APP_BASE_DIR` — Local directory holding the base FL application templates (the repo's `fl-apps/` tree), baked into the flip-api image and bind-mounted in dev. flip-api walks `<FL_APP_BASE_DIR>/<backend>/<job_type>/` to bundle an application (uploading those files into `FL_APP_DESTINATION_BUCKET/<model_id>`) and reads each backend's manifest from `<FL_APP_BASE_DIR>/<backend>/required_files.json`. Default `/app/fl-apps`; override to mount operator-provided templates. Replaces the removed `FL_APP_BASE_BUCKET` S3 dependency (FLIP#724): base templates are no longer published to S3 (the `fl-apps-push-s3-*` sync workflows are gone), so a template hotfix now ships by rebuilding + redeploying the flip-api image rather than syncing S3. `fl-apps/` is baked into the image via a BuildKit named build context (`fl_apps=../fl-apps`) since it sits outside flip-api's build context. For the Flower backend, the template pyprojects also steer Flower's **per-run dependency install** (`uv sync` on every app launch; SuperNodes opt in via `--allow-runtime-dependency-installation` in the composes): `[tool.uv.sources]` pins `flip-utils` to the source kept at `/opt/flip-utils` inside the FL images (never PyPI — FLIP#767; a flip-utils change ships by rebuilding the FL images, `make build-fl FL_BACKEND=flower`) and torch/torchvision to the cu128 index (PyPI's default cu130 wheels need driver >=580).
- `FL_KIT_SLOT_NAMES` — JSON list (e.g. `["Trust_1", "Trust_2"]`) of FL kit-slot names for the hub's `fl_kit_slot` pool that `register_trust` claims from; each name must match a provisioned participant kit (in-tree workspace for dev, `s3://<AICENTRE_BUCKET_NAME>/fl-flare-participant-kits/<FLARE_KIT_DATE>/net-<N>/services/<slot>/` for stag/prod; slot names are global across nets — every net carries a kit per name). The pool is seeded at flip-api boot and **reconciled on demand** when a registration finds it exhausted (`resolve_fl_kit_slot_names`, additive — never deletes or re-assigns rows); only then does `NoFreeKitSlotError` surface. Single source per env: dev = this env var (a `DevSettings`-only field; restart to change, settings load once); stag/prod = the `/flip/fl_kit_slot_names` SSM parameter (Terraform-rendered from this var — the list is plain config, not a secret; deliberately **no env fallback**, so a broken/missing parameter means the pool can't grow, loudly, never masked by stale task-def env). Growing the pool is an env-file edit + `make -C deploy/providers/AWS apply-fl-kit-slots` (targeted plan/apply of just the parameter, plain-text diff) — **no restart, no task-definition change**. One-command workflow: `make -C deploy/providers/AWS add-fl-kits N=<n> PROD=stag|true` (N = "ensure N more live slots": activate spares toward N first, mint only the shortfall on every net → additive S3 upload → env edit → parameter apply); full runbook in `fl-services/nvflare/README.md` ("Onboarding a new client onto an existing network"). NVFLARE-only dynamics — Flower's SuperNode key labelling reads the list at net startup.
- `PROD` — `true` (production), `stag` (staging), unset (development)
- `AES_KEY_BASE64` — encryption key for trust communication
- A remote trust operator only needs their kit file (`trust/.env.<KIT>`) — no hub `.env.<env>` needed on trust hosts.
  See `trust/README.md` for the standalone-operator quick-start.
- `TRUST_API_KEY` — single per-trust plaintext API key, lives only in that trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`), never on the hub
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER` — HTTP header name for internal service auth
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` — internal service key for fl-server-to-hub auth (Central Hub only)
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HASH` — hub-side SHA-256 hash of the internal service key
- `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER` — HTTP header name for trust-internal service auth, sent by every caller (trust-api, imaging-api, fl-client) on every call to imaging-api or data-access-api. Default `X-Trust-Internal-Service-Key`.
- `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` — per-trust plaintext key carried in the trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`), minted by `register_trust`. Read by every trust-internal container; used by trust-api / imaging-api / data-access-api / fl-client to authenticate one another inside the trust. Each trust uses a distinct key — see the **Trust-internal Service Authentication** section below for the threat model. Distinct from the hub's `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY*`: per-trust scope, never sent to or stored on the hub.
- Trusts are NOT enumerated in the hub env file. The kit files (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`) ARE the roster: `make new-trust TRUST_CODE=<CODE> TRUST_NAME="..."` scaffolds one, `make register-trust KIT=<CODE>` registers it. The old `TRUST_<n>_NAME` / `TRUST_<n>_CODE` / `TRUST_<n>_REGION` / `TRUST_<n>_HOST` deploy vars and `register-trust-<n>` targets are removed.
- `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` — public base URL of flip-api (with `/api`); read by flip-ui and trust-api. In prod this is the CloudFront URL.
- `FLIP_API_INTERNAL_URL` — Central-Hub-internal base URL of flip-api (with `/api`); read **only** by fl-server. Must resolve over the Docker network (e.g. `http://flip-api:8000/api`), never the CloudFront URL — CloudFront strips `X-Internal-Service-Key` at the edge.
- Database auth — In production (`ENV=production`) flip-api authenticates to Postgres through **RDS Proxy** using a short-lived AWS IAM auth token minted per-connection by a SQLAlchemy `do_connect` hook in `flip_api/db/database.py` (passwordless engine URL, `sslmode=require`, `pool_pre_ping` + `pool_recycle`). The proxy reaches RDS with the rotating RDS-managed master secret it re-reads natively, so the app holds no static DB credential and secret rotation no longer causes an outage (FLIP#556). Dev (`ENV=development`) uses the static `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` from the environment. There is no separate toggle — the path is selected by `ENV`.
- `ENFORCE_MFA` — `true` (the `Settings` default; do **not** set in `.env*` files for stag/prod) gates every authenticated route on TOTP enrolment via the app-layer MFA check in `verify_token`. The dev override lives in `deploy/compose.development.yml` (`ENFORCE_MFA=false`) so local development doesn't force enrolment on a burner authenticator app. Production compose (`compose.production.yml`) passes `ENFORCE_MFA=${ENFORCE_MFA:-true}` so the env var can be overridden from `.env.stag`/`.env.prod` for testing, but falls back to the secure `true` default when unset. Intentionally not in `.env.development.example` or AWS Secrets Manager — the Settings default (`true`) is the canonical secure anchor. The UI mirrors this flag from `/users/me/mfa/status` and skips the enrolment redirect when it's false.
- `MAX_MODEL_FILE_BYTES` — Hard cap on the file size of a single model-file upload, in bytes. Bound on the presigned POST policy so S3 rejects oversized payloads at the edge — the hub never sees them. Default `5368709120` (5 GiB) — raised from 100 MiB so large evaluation checkpoints (e.g. the ~759 MiB Ark+ weights, ~1.5 GiB for the multimodel variant) can be uploaded; such checkpoints are staged server-side by the FL API and loaded by the fl-server, not bundled into the app deployed to clients. The S3 policy condition allows a small fixed overhead above this for multipart/form-data framing (see `_MULTIPART_OVERHEAD_BUFFER_BYTES` in `flip_api/utils/s3_client.py`); the UI guard at `flip-ui/src/utils/file.ts` compares against this raw value so a file at exactly the cap is accepted on both sides.
- `PRE_SIGNED_URL_EXPIRATION_SECONDS` — Setting default for presigned-URL TTLs, in seconds: the model-file presigned POST policy (upload) and the presigned GET URLs for model-file downloads (FLIP#784). The hub silently clamps to the 1800s (30 min) security ceiling encoded as `MAX_PRESIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS` in `flip_api/utils/s3_client.py` (a leaked URL is a capability against the bucket in either direction — writable for POST, readable for GET — so the leak window must stay tight). The ceiling is 1800s rather than the original 600s to give larger transfers (up to the `MAX_MODEL_FILE_BYTES` cap) enough time to complete. Setting default equals the ceiling (1800) so default-configured deployments never trip the clamp; over-ceiling operator values leave a warning in the logs and are clamped.
- `UPLOADED_MODEL_FILES_BUCKET` / `SCANNED_MODEL_FILES_BUCKET` — the two model-file prefixes, and the platform's quarantine boundary (FLIP#52). Researcher uploads are written to the `uploaded/` staging prefix by the presigned POST policy; `POST /files/process-scanned-file/{model_id}/{file}` registers the row as `SCANNING` and schedules the scan, which promotes clean files into `scanned/` and deletes rejected ones. Every consumer — the FL app bundler (`fl_services/services/fl_service.py`), model-file downloads, and listings — reads `scanned/` only, so an unscanned or rejected file can never be bundled to a trust. **They must point at distinct prefixes**: pointed at the same location the promote step degrades to a no-op (logged) and the boundary disappears.
- `ALLOWED_MODEL_FILE_EXTENSIONS` — extension whitelist enforced before a presigned POST policy is minted, so a disallowed type never reaches S3. JSON list or comma-separated string, matched case-insensitively; default `.py .json .toml .pt .pth .pkl .txt .yaml .yml .safetensors`. `.toml` is **required by the Flower backend** — every Flower app and tutorial ships a `config.toml` run-config that fl-api-flower feeds to `flwr run --run-config`, so dropping it rejects every Flower upload. Opaque archives (`.zip`/`.tar`) are excluded — the scan pipeline cannot gate their contents. A value that normalises to nothing (`",,,"`) falls back to the default rather than an empty list, which would otherwise reject everything (or, for `PICKLESCAN_FILE_SUFFIXES`, silently skip all scanning). A rejection returns 400 with the allowed set, which the UI surfaces verbatim.
- `PICKLESCAN_FILE_SUFFIXES` / `PICKLESCAN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` — which uploads get a structural picklescan before promotion (default `.pt .pth .pkl .pickle`) and the wall-clock cap per scan (default 120s). Dangerous globals mark the file `INFECTED` and delete the object; a scan that errors or times out fails closed to `ERROR`. Signature-based AV (GuardDuty Malware Protection for S3) is tracked separately in FLIP#838.
- `BANDIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` — wall-clock cap (default 60s) on the non-blocking Bandit pass over `.py` uploads (FLIP#877, GHSA-8465). Unlike `PICKLESCAN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` a timeout here just means no findings are recorded (fail-open, never `ERROR`) — Bandit is advisory only and never gates promotion. Findings land on `UploadedFiles.bandit_findings` (`[]` = scanned clean, `NULL` = never scanned) and surface in the UI as an amber indicator. `bandit` is a dependency baked into the `flip-api` image, not the mounted `src/`: under the dev pull-by-default sourcing above, running without `BUILD=true` after picking up this dependency serves an image with no `bandit` binary, so every upload silently records `NULL` findings while the UI and docs still claim a scan ran.
- `SCHEDULER_MALWARE_SCAN_RECONCILE_RATE` — how often (minutes, default 1) the sweep re-checks uploads left `SCANNING` by an app restart mid-scan.

## Deployment Architecture

- **Cloud-Only**: Central Hub (ECS Fargate) + Trust (EC2) on AWS
- **Hybrid**: Central Hub on AWS + Trust on local/on-prem host
- Trusts poll Central Hub over HTTPS (outbound only). No inbound ports on trust hosts.
- SSH access via AWS SSM Session Manager only (no port 22 open).

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions: `test_flip_api.yml`, `test_flip_ui.yml`, `test_trust_*.yml`, `fl-tutorials-tests.yml`, `docker_build_*.yml`, `validate_terraform.yml`, `secret-scanning.yml`, `docs.yml`, `pr_acceptance_criteria.yml`. Run locally: `make ci` (uses `act`).

### Docker image builds: gated on tests, manual trigger for branches

**The application `docker_build_*.yml` workflows (`flip_api`, `trust_trust_api`, `trust_imaging_api`, `trust_data_access_api`, `omop_db`) auto-publish to GHCR only after their service's test workflow passes on `develop` or `main`.** They trigger via `workflow_run` on the matching test workflow (`FLIP API CI`, `Trust - Trust API CI`, etc.) and a job-level `if` gates on `workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'` — a red test suite never publishes. Path filtering is inherited from the test workflow, so a build still only fires when that service changed. (`orthanc`, `xnat_*` keep their direct push trigger — they have no separate test workflow to gate on; `orthanc` instead runs an in-job auth smoke test between build and push, and also on PRs touching `trust/orthanc/**`, so a red smoke never publishes — FLIP-PT-091; `flip-ui` is a CI smoke test that never publishes.)

Every publish also pushes an immutable **`sha-<short7>`** tag (first 7 chars of the built commit) alongside the mutable `:stag`/`:prod` tags. Hub ECS deploys pin these sha tags via task-definition revisions — `make deploy-centralhub` resolves the env branch tip's tag, `make rollback-centralhub` repoints at the previous revision (FLIP#751; see `deploy/providers/AWS/README.md` "Central Hub deploys and rollback"). `deploy-centralhub` also prints an **FL quiesce reminder** (FLIP#770; on `PROD=true` it adds an interactive are-you-sure confirmation, stag stays non-interactive): replacing `fl-server-net-1` kills any in-flight training run, so enable deployment mode first — it pauses FL job pickup (queued jobs hold; the running job finishes and frees its net) — and wait until the hub's `GET /fl/quiesce` reports deployment mode ON and no BUSY net, making "enable mode → wait → deploy → disable" the standard redeploy workflow.

> **Note:** `workflow_run` triggers only take effect once these workflow files are on the repo's **default branch**. The first merge that introduces them won't retroactively publish; subsequent qualifying pushes will.

Branch pushes do NOT build images. If you pin a branch-named tag in a compose file (e.g. `ghcr.io/londonaicentre/flip-api:my-feature-branch`) for prod testing, manually trigger the relevant build workflow via `workflow_dispatch` (which bypasses the test gate):

```bash
gh workflow run docker_build_flip_api.yml --ref <branch-name>
gh workflow run docker_build_flip_ui.yml --ref <branch-name>          # only if UI image is consumed; deploy-ui builds locally
gh workflow run docker_build_trust_trust_api.yml --ref <branch-name>
# ...one per service whose image you've pinned
```

Wait for green completion (`gh run list --workflow=docker_build_flip_api.yml --branch <branch>`) before redeploying. The `flip-ui` is rebuilt locally by `make deploy-ui` and does not consume GHCR; the rest do.

## Pre-commit Hooks

TruffleHog, detect-secrets, large file check (max 1000KB), merge conflict markers, YAML validation, private key detection, env var validation, fl-apps required-files generation (`fl-apps-required-files` — regenerates each `fl-apps/<backend>/required_files.json` from its per-template arrays via `fl-apps/check_required_files.sh`; rewrites-and-fails on drift like `prettier`, so re-stage and commit again — backstopped by the `check-required-files` CI workflow. The aggregate is `linguist-generated` in `.gitattributes`; never hand-edit it — edit the per-template `required_files.json`), uv lockfile sync (`uv-lock`, one entry per uv project). Install: `pre-commit install`.

## Security Rules

- Never commit secrets/credentials (pre-commit hooks enforce this).
- SSH-over-SSM mandatory (no port 22 exposed).
- Never bypass TLS (`curl -k` prohibited).
- Use `AES_KEY_BASE64` for trust communication encryption.
- AWS Cognito for hub auth, per-trust API keys for trust-to-hub auth.
- Internal service key for fl-server-to-hub auth (separate from trust keys).
- Trust-internal service key for trust-api / imaging-api / fl-client → imaging-api / data-access-api auth (per-trust, never leaves trust env). See **Trust-internal Service Authentication** below.
- FL clients intentionally have no Central Hub credentials.
- Cohort-query validation is three-layer and **deliberately asymmetric — do not "sync" the layers**. Only the trust-side `data_access_api.services.cohort.validate_query` is authoritative (single parse-validate-emit; length, single-statement, SELECT-only, no `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`MERGE` anywhere in the tree — a writable CTE parses as a top-level `Select`, so the shape check alone misses it — `omop`-schema pin, literal `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`; re-emits from the checked AST; backed by the read-only `data_analyst_reader` role — pass its return value to the engine, never the caller's raw string). The hub-side `flip_api.cohort_services.submit_cohort_query.validate_query` is a *fast-feedback validity pre-check only, not a security control*: it exists so a malformed query fails in-hand instead of after an async fan-out to every trust, and enforces only what every trust would reject anyway. The flip-ui cohort form validates required-field only. A trust must stay safe regardless of what the hub checked, so hub drift is safe by construction. **No layer uses a keyword denylist** — the removed one blocked legitimate `SUBSTRING()` while stopping nothing; blind extraction is defeated by the literal-`LIMIT` rule and DDL/DML by the read-only role. See [`trust/data-access-api/README.md`](trust/data-access-api/README.md#cohort-query-validation).
- Row-level cohort egress is gated on `COHORT_QUERY_THRESHOLD` at **both** row-level routes — `/cohort/dataframe` (FL training data) and `/cohort/accession-ids` (the accession list that decides whose imaging is pulled into XNAT) — sharing one fixed refusal string so a below-threshold cohort is indistinguishable from an empty one. The threshold is the trust's own disclosure floor (default 10, set per trust in its kit file), enforced trust-side rather than relying on the hub's staging guard. Both gates evaluate the **live** cohort on every call: FLIP stores the cohort only as a SQL string and re-runs it against OMOP at every stage, so a project can import cleanly and later start refusing (FLIP#857).
- Do not hardcode env values in Dockerfiles or compose files.
- 72-hour supply-chain cooldown on Python/npm package installs — enforced by uv `exclude-newer` (`[tool.uv]` in every `pyproject.toml`) and npm `min-release-age` (`flip-ui/.npmrc`, requires npm >= 11.10 which Node 24 LTS ships), backstopped by a `uv lock --check` CI gate in `secret-scanning.yml`. See CONTRIBUTING.md ("Dependency cooldown").

## Trust-internal Service Authentication

**Threat.** Imaging-api proxies privileged XNAT operations using a service account; data-access-api executes arbitrary SQL against OMOP using a service account. Without caller authentication on these APIs, any container on the trust Docker network — or any operator with SSM port-forward access — can drive XNAT-admin operations and run unrestricted OMOP queries. Both surfaces sit behind no inbound firewall on the trust host (everything is internal to the Docker network) and neither used to validate the caller's identity.

**Mitigation.** Every trust-internal call carries a shared-secret header. The header name comes from `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER` (default `X-Trust-Internal-Service-Key`), the value is the per-trust `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` from the trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`). Receivers (imaging-api, data-access-api) compare the header against their own copy of the key with `hmac.compare_digest` (constant-time, defeats timing side-channels). Senders are trust-api, imaging-api (when calling data-access-api `/cohort/accession-ids`), and fl-client. The same key is held in plaintext by every trust-internal container — the trust boundary is the trust itself, not individual service-pairs within it. `/health` stays unauthenticated so liveness probes keep working.

**Per-trust scope.** Each trust gets a distinct key. A leak in Trust_1 cannot drive operations on Trust_2's APIs. The hub never sees these keys — they live only in trust-side env: `register_trust` writes `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` into the trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`), which `trust/Makefile` `-include`s so every trust-internal container inherits it. This is deliberately distinct from the hub's `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` (which protects fl-server → flip-api on the Central Hub).

**Generating keys.** The key is minted by `register_trust` (`make register-trusts`), which writes `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` into the trust's kit file. Re-register to rotate.

**Per-service code.** The auth check lives in each receiving service's `utils/internal_auth.py`:

- `trust/imaging-api/imaging_api/utils/internal_auth.py` — applied at the router level on every imaging-api router except `/health`.
- `trust/data-access-api/data_access_api/utils/internal_auth.py` — applied at the router level on `/cohort` (covers `/cohort`, `/cohort/dataframe`, `/cohort/accession-ids`).

The senders construct the header inline at call sites:

- `trust-api/trust_api/services/task_handlers.py::_trust_internal_headers()` — used on outbound imaging-api and data-access-api calls.
- `imaging-api/imaging_api/services_external/data_access.py` — used on the outbound `/cohort/accession-ids` call.
- The `flip` Python package — lives at [`flip-utils/flip/`](flip-utils/flip/) in this mono-repo, consumed by both the NVFLARE and Flower fl-client / fl-server images built from `fl-services/`. Wraps every fl-client call to imaging-api (`flip.get_by_accession_number`, etc.) and data-access-api (`flip.get_dataframe`). The package reads `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` from `os.environ` and forwards it on every request. **User-uploaded training code (`client_app.py`, `server_app.py`, anything under `tutorials/`) does not deal with the header directly** — it calls `flip.*` and the package handles transport-level auth.

## Code Modification Rules

1. Follow existing code style and conventions.
2. Add/update tests covering new functionality.
3. Run `make test` or `make unit_test` before committing.
4. Update documentation as needed.
5. Commit with clear messages. All commits signed off by human author alone (`git commit -s`).
6. Add new deps to `pyproject.toml` or `package.json`, document in service README.
7. Use SOLID principles. Aim for high test coverage on critical paths.
