# Client API model evaluation

## Overview

This is the NVFLARE **Client API** evaluation job type (`JOB_TYPE=evaluation`). It evaluates
every uploaded model listed in `config.json['models']` across every site and reports aggregate
metrics. It replaced the retired
Executor-based `evaluation` template, which paired the `RUN_EVALUATOR` executor with the bespoke
`ModelEval` + `EvaluationPTModelLocator` (multi-model `COLLECTION`) server flow.

Here the server reuses the same cross-site validation path as the
[`standard`](../standard/README.md) training template:
`InitEvaluation` → stock `GlobalModelEval` → `BroadcastTask` cleanup.
Only server-provided models are validated. `EvaluationModelLocator` serves every entry in
`config.json['models']` (multi-model works, e.g. the Ark+ multimodel eval), and each is broadcast
as its own single-model validate task per (model, client) — one `FLModel` at a time.

The base configs (`app/config/config_fed_server.json`, `app/config/config_fed_client.json`) and
`meta.json` are **recipe-generated** from `flip.nvflare.recipes.FlipEvalRecipe`. Do not hand-edit them —
regenerate via `recipe.py` after any recipe change and commit the result.

## What's the logic?

1. `InitEvaluation` reports evaluation start to the Central Hub, runs the client image-cleanup task,
   and validates that `config.json` declares the model(s) to evaluate.
2. `GlobalModelEval` loads the uploaded checkpoint via `EvaluationModelLocator` and broadcasts it to
   every site as a single `FLModel` (`validate` task).
3. Each site runs the user's `evaluator.py` via `InProcessClientAPIExecutor`, using the NVFLARE Client
   API `is_evaluate()` path (`flare.receive()` / `flare.send()`) to receive the model and return
   **aggregate-only** metrics (`DataKind.METRICS`).
4. `EvaluationJsonGenerator` collects the metrics into `evaluation_results.json` and every failed
   `validate` task into `evaluation_failures.json`, and `PersistToS3AndCleanup` zips + uploads the
   run directory to S3.

There is **no `validator.py`** and no client model submission — the evaluator only scores the
server-provided model.

## Outputs

Both files land in `evaluation_results/` inside the results zip.

`evaluation_results.json` is keyed by data site, then by the validated model's name (`GlobalModelEval`
sends one `validate` task per (model, client), so each model gets its own entry):

```json
{
  "Trust_1": {
    "SRV_arkplus_pretrained": { "auroc": 0.839 },
    "SRV_arkplus_finetuned": { "auroc": 0.871 }
  }
}
```

`evaluation_failures.json` lists every `validate` task that did not return metrics. It is always
written, so an empty list `[]` positively means "no task failed" rather than "this FLIP version
didn't record them":

```json
[{ "model": "SRV_arkplus_pretrained", "client": "Trust_1", "return_code": "TASK_ABORTED" }]
```

When **every** `validate` task fails the model ends in `ERROR`, not `RESULTS_UPLOADED`. The results
are still uploaded either way — the zip is what carries `evaluation_failures.json` and `error_log.txt`.
A partial failure (some tasks succeeded) uploads the successful metrics and reports `RESULTS_UPLOADED`,
with the failed tasks recorded in `evaluation_failures.json`.

## Execution sequence

**Server — `config_fed_server.json` `workflows` (run in order):**

1. `flip.nvflare.controllers.InitEvaluation`
2. `nvflare.app_common.workflows.global_model_eval.GlobalModelEval`
3. `flip.nvflare.controllers.BroadcastTask`

**Client — `config_fed_client.json` `executors`:**

- `init_task`, `post_validation` → `flip.nvflare.components.CleanupImages`
- `validate` → `nvflare.app_common.executors.InProcessClientAPIExecutor`
- Event handler: `ClientEventHandler`

## What does the user upload?

The required files (see [`required_files.json`](./required_files.json)) are:

- `evaluator.py` — the Client-API evaluation loop. Receive the global model (`flare.receive()`), score
  it on the local cohort, and return aggregate metrics via `flare.send(FLModel(metrics=...))`.
- `models.py` — defines the model; `models.get_model` is what the server persistor instantiates.
- `config.json` — evaluation configuration consumed by the custom code (e.g. `num_classes`, the
  `models` checkpoint mapping, the cohort `query`).

Helper modules (e.g. `transforms.py`) and the model checkpoint are uploaded alongside these.

## Regenerating the committed configs

After any change to `FlipEvalRecipe` (in `flip-utils/flip/nvflare/recipes/`), regenerate the committed
JSONs by running from the `flip-utils` venv:

```bash
cd flip-utils && uv run --no-sync python - <<'PY'
import sys, types, torch, runpy
m = types.ModuleType("models"); m.get_model = lambda: torch.nn.Linear(1, 1); sys.modules["models"] = m
sys.argv = ["recipe.py", "--output", "../fl-apps/nvflare/evaluation"]
runpy.run_path("../fl-apps/nvflare/evaluation/recipe.py", run_name="__main__")
PY
```

Then commit all three updated files: `app/config/config_fed_server.json`,
`app/config/config_fed_client.json`, and `meta.json`.
