# Standard federated training (Flower)

## Overview

The baseline Flower job type (`job_type=standard`): supervised **Federated Averaging** via
[`FlipFedAvg`](../../../flip-utils/flip/flower/strategy.py), which adds the Central Hub telemetry
(status, per-client metrics and exceptions, round events) on top of Flower's `FedAvg`. The template
subclasses it as `FedAvgWithClientMetrics` in [`app/strategy.py`](app/strategy.py) to capture
per-client metrics for the results JSON and to evaluate on the final round only.

## What does the user upload?

The required files (see [`required_files.json`](./required_files.json)) are:

- `client_app.py` — the Flower `ClientApp`, defining `@app.train` and `@app.evaluate`.
- `models.py` — defines the model; `models.get_model` is what `server_app.py` instantiates to seed
  the initial global arrays.

`app/server_app.py`, `app/strategy.py` and `pyproject.toml` ship with the template. Base files win
over uploaded ones — [`bundle_flower_application`](../../../flip-api/src/flip_api/fl_services/services/fl_service.py)
skips any uploaded file whose name collides with a base file — so a user cannot replace the server
app, the strategy or the project config.

## Differential privacy: expected in the uploaded `client_app.py`

`client_app.py` is **uploaded, not templated**, so this template cannot wire the privacy filter
itself the way the NVFLARE templates do (theirs is a `task_result_filters` entry in the
FLIP-owned `config_fed_client.json`). An uploaded Flower training app is expected to privatise its
update by registering FLIP's DP mod on its training handler:

```python
from flip.flower.privacy import flip_local_dp_mod

app = ClientApp()

@app.train(mods=[flip_local_dp_mod])          # training only — leave @app.evaluate alone
def train(msg: Message, context: Context) -> Message:
    ...
```

The mod clips the local update to `dp-clipping-norm` and adds Gaussian noise calibrated to
(`dp-epsilon`, `dp-delta`) before the reply leaves the SuperNode, and is toggled by `dp-enabled` in
`[tool.flwr.app.config]`. See [`flip.flower.privacy`](../../../flip-utils/flip/flower/privacy.py)
for the mechanism and the shipped tutorials for worked examples:
[`numpy`](../../../fl-tutorials/flower/numpy/README.md),
[`xray_classification`](../../../fl-tutorials/flower/xray_classification/README.md) and
[`3d_spleen_segmentation`](../../../fl-tutorials/flower/3d_spleen_segmentation/README.md).

> ⚠️ **This is a convention enforced by code review before upload, not by the platform.** An
> uploaded `client_app.py` that omits the mod will train and aggregate perfectly happily while
> sharing raw model updates. Making it un-bypassable needs a FLIP-owned ClientApp shim that
> `pyproject.toml`'s `clientapp = …` points at — base files win over uploads, so such a shim could
> not be overridden. That is not built yet.

## Run it

The chest-X-ray and 3D spleen-segmentation Flower tutorials both use this job type:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials download-xray-data FL_BACKEND=flower
make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=xray_classification FL_BACKEND=flower
```

See [`fl-tutorials/flower/`](../../../fl-tutorials/flower/) for the available tutorials and their
datasets.
