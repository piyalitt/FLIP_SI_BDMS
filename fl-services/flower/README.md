# Flower Federated Learning services

This folder contains the Flower FL service images and the per-network provisioning that
secures them. A Flower network is a long-running **SuperLink** (server) that several
long-running **SuperNode**s (clients) connect to, plus a thin `fl-api` that the Central
Hub drives. `fl-base` holds the shared base image the others build on.

Unlike NVFLARE (which mints per-participant *startup kits*), Flower provisioning generates
**TLS certificates** for secure SuperLink↔SuperNode↔CLI communication and **SuperNode
authentication key pairs** — the Flower equivalent of the per-trust identity. See the
upstream how-tos for the underlying mechanics:
[TLS connections](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-enable-tls-connections.html) and
[SuperNode authentication](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-authenticate-supernodes.html).

## Images: built in CI, or locally as `:dev`

The Flower images — `flower-fl-base`, `flower-superlink`, `flower-supernode`, `flower-fl-api`
— are built in CI by [`fl-docker-build-flower.yml`](../../.github/workflows/fl-docker-build-flower.yml)
whenever `fl-services/flower/**` or `flip-utils/**` change, and published to GHCR as `:<sha>`,
`:stag` (on `develop`) and `:prod` (on `main`). Deployments pull them via `DOCKER_FL_TAG`.

To iterate locally **before pushing**, build them tagged `:dev`:

```bash
make -C fl-services/flower build                  # flwr-base first, then superlink/supernode/fl-api
make -C fl-services/flower build LOCAL_DEV=true   # include dev-only deps
make up FL_BACKEND=flower DOCKER_FL_REGISTRY= DOCKER_FL_TAG=dev   # run the hub stack on local images
```

`DOCKER_FL_REGISTRY=` empties the registry so Docker resolves the local `flower-*:dev` images
(see [`deploy/fl_backend.mk`](../../deploy/fl_backend.mk)).

### Containers run as a non-root user (GHSA-8465), with capabilities hardened

`flower-supernode` and `flower-fl-base` inherit the non-root `app` user from the upstream `flwr/base`
image. The trust-deployment `fl-client-net-*` services (`trust/deploy/compose_trust.{production,development}.flower.yml`)
also set `security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]` and `cap_drop: [ALL]`, matching every other trust-side
service — the `flower-supernode` entrypoint does no chmod/chown at all, so no capability needs adding
back in either environment. See [`deploy/README.md`](../../deploy/README.md#linux-capability-restrictions)
for the full per-service capability table.

## Runtime dependency installation (and where flip-utils comes from)

Flower ≥1.32 installs an app's declared dependencies **at run time**: when a run starts, the
SuperLink (ServerApp side) and each SuperNode (ClientApp side, opted in with
`--allow-runtime-dependency-installation` in the composes) run `uv sync` against the FAB's
`pyproject.toml` into an isolated per-run environment, which is prepended to `sys.path`.

Left alone, that would resolve `flip-utils` from **PyPI**, silently shadowing the in-repo copy baked
into the images ([#767](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues/767)). Two `[tool.uv]` tables
in the `fl-apps/flower/*` template pyprojects steer the per-run resolution instead:

- `[tool.uv.sources] flip-utils = { path = "/opt/flip-utils" }` — `fl-base` keeps the in-repo
  flip-utils **source** at `/opt/flip-utils` after installing it, and every run builds flip-utils
  from that path. uv never consults PyPI for a name with a source override, so the platform always
  runs the flip-utils matching its images.
- `torch`/`torchvision` are pinned to PyTorch's cu128 index (PyPI's default cu130 wheels need
  NVIDIA driver ≥580; FLIP hosts run 575.x).

All other dependencies resolve from PyPI per run, so SuperLink/SuperNode hosts need outbound HTTPS
to PyPI and `download.pytorch.org`.

**Testing an unpublished flip-utils** therefore needs no PyPI release and no version bump: rebuild
the images from your branch (`make build-fl FL_BACKEND=flower` — the source lands at
`/opt/flip-utils`) and restart the flower services onto the rebuilt `:dev` images
(`make restart-fl FL_BACKEND=flower DOCKER_FL_REGISTRY= DOCKER_FL_TAG=dev` for the hub stack).
Every flip-utils change ships via an image rebuild — the containers run whatever their image bakes,
so confirm the running container carries your change by inspecting the file you edited
(`docker exec <supernode> cat /opt/flip-utils/flip/<changed file>`) before trusting a run.

> ⚠️ The pin lives in the **fl-apps templates**, so it covers hub-stack runs (flip-api bundles every
> uploaded app with a template). The standalone stacks below submit apps straight from
> `fl-tutorials/flower/`, bypassing the templates — and a tutorial pyproject **cannot** carry the
> same pin, because `/opt/flip-utils` does not exist on a workstation and `uv sync` then fails
> outright (breaking local linting of the tutorial). The tutorials therefore **do not declare
> flip-utils at all**: with nothing to install, the per-run environment has no `flip`, and
> `import flip` falls through the prepended per-run path to the image's baked-in copy — the same
> flip-utils the platform runs.
>
> Declaring it is the trap: `uv sync` would resolve `flip-utils` from **PyPI** (currently 0.1.8,
> against the repo's 0.4.0) into the per-run environment, which is prepended to `sys.path` and so
> shadows the image copy. PyPI 0.1.8 has no `flip/flower/strategy.py`, so a declared dependency
> breaks `from flip.flower.strategy import FlipFedAvg` before training starts. Either way, a
> flip-utils change reaches the tutorials only via an image rebuild
> (`make build-fl FL_BACKEND=flower`).

## Step-by-step provisioning

Provisioning lives under [`provision/`](provision/): the [`scripts/`](provision/scripts/) that
generate the credentials, and the gitignored `creds/` output they write.

### What gets generated

`make -C fl-services/flower provision NET_NUMBER=<N>` runs
[`provision/scripts/generate-tls-certificates.sh`](provision/scripts/generate-tls-certificates.sh),
which drives the vendored `generate_creds.py` to produce, per network:

```
provision/creds/net-<N>/
├── certificates/   ca.crt, ca.key, server.pem, server.key   # TLS for SuperLink/SuperNode/CLI
└── keys/           supernode_credentials_<i>{,.pub}          # SuperNode auth key pairs (2 by default)
```

> ⚠️ These are development credentials. Configure validity, organization, the server SANs
> (`SERVER_SAN_IPS`), or the number of SuperNode key pairs by editing the globals at the top
> of [`provision/scripts/generate_creds.py`](provision/scripts/generate_creds.py).

### Provisioning command

```bash
make -C fl-services/flower provision NET_NUMBER=1   # → provision/creds/net-1/
make -C fl-services/flower provision NET_NUMBER=2   # second net for the default dev stack
```

`creds/` is the gitignored `FL_PROVISIONED_DIR` for Flower (see
[`deploy/fl_backend.mk`](../../deploy/fl_backend.mk)); the dev compose overlays and the standalone
[`compose.secure.yml`](compose.secure.yml) mount `certificates/` into `/certs` and `keys/` into
`/keys`.

### How SuperNodes are authenticated

The SuperLink only accepts SuperNodes whose **public** key it has been told about. Each
SuperNode's `.pub` key is registered with the SuperLink (and, in the hub, mapped to a trust name)
by [`register-supernode-keys.sh`](register-supernode-keys.sh) — it runs `flwr supernode register`
for every `/keys/*.pub`, skipping already-registered keys. This is the Flower analogue of claiming
a participant slot.

## Running a network standalone (no hub / trusts)

```bash
make -C fl-services/flower up                 # INSECURE stack (1 SuperLink + 2 SuperNodes + fl-api)
make -C fl-services/flower up-secure          # SECURE stack (TLS + SuperNode auth); needs `provision` first
make -C fl-services/flower submit APP=numpy   # submit a job to the running stack
make -C fl-services/flower down
```

The central-hub multi-net Flower topology is the separate
[`deploy/compose.development.flower.yml`](../../deploy/compose.development.flower.yml), driven by the
root `make up FL_BACKEND=flower`.
