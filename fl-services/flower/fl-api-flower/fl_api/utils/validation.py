"""Boundary input validation for the FL API.

The FL API performs no authentication of its own — it trusts that the only caller is
flip-api / fl-server on the trust's internal Docker network. To keep that trust from
becoming a path-traversal or SSRF foothold (a compromised trust container, or an
operator with an SSM port-forward, could reach the API directly), every request value
that becomes a filesystem path or an outbound fetch is validated here first.
