# NVFLARE Federated Learning Services

This folder contains base code to create NVIDIA FLARE federated learning networks, each containing a set of clients, a server and an API. `fl-api-base` and `fl-base` are base services used by the provisioning command to build upon. `fl-base` can be used to test applications locally, but is a single container that does not constitute a fully working FL network.

## Anatomy of a network

A provisioned **network** (`net-N`) is a self-contained FLARE deployment. Each net runs:

- **`fl-server`** (image `flare-fl-server`) — the single FLARE server that coordinates rounds and aggregates client updates.
- **`fl-api`** (image `flare-fl-api`) — a FastAPI service wrapping the FLARE admin `Session`. The Central Hub drives the net **only** through this API (submit/abort jobs, poll server/client status). See [`fl-api-base/README.md`](./fl-api-base/README.md).
- **`fl-client-1 … fl-client-N`** (image `flare-fl-client`) — one client per participating trust, each holding that trust's signed startup kit.

`fl-base` and `fl-api-base` are the **base build contexts** the provisioning step layers on top of: `fl-base` backs the server and clients, `fl-api-base` backs the API. `fl-base` alone runs as a single container for local app testing, but is not a working FL network.

Provisioning mints, per participant, a signed **startup kit** under `provision/workspace-dev/net-N/services/<participant>/` — a `startup/` folder (`root_CA.pem`, `signature.json`, `fed_*.json`, `*.crt`/`*.key`, `start.sh`/`sub_start.sh`/`stop_fl.sh`) and a `local/` folder. The shared root CA that signs these kits is what binds a net together — see [Step-by-step provisioning](#step-by-step-provisioning) below.

## Images: built in CI, or locally as `:dev`

The four FL images — `flare-fl-base`, `flare-fl-server`, `flare-fl-client`, `flare-fl-api` — are built
in CI by [`fl-docker-build-nvflare.yml`](../../.github/workflows/fl-docker-build-nvflare.yml) whenever
`fl-services/nvflare/**` or `flip-utils/**` change, and published to GHCR as `:<sha>`, `:stag` (on `develop`)
and `:prod` (on `main`).
Deployments pull them via `DOCKER_FL_TAG`, so a change to fl-api code or the `flip` package flows into the
next deployment on that tag.

To iterate locally **before pushing**, build them tagged `:dev` from the repo root:

```bash
make build-fl                  # builds flare-fl-{base,server,client,api}:dev (base first, then derived)
make build-fl LOCAL_DEV=true   # include dev-only deps (e.g. plotting for the diffusion app)
```

Then run the stack on those local images instead of GHCR:

```bash
make up DOCKER_FL_REGISTRY= DOCKER_FL_TAG=dev
```

`DOCKER_FL_REGISTRY=` empties the registry so Docker resolves the local `flare-fl-*:dev` images (see
[`deploy/fl_backend.mk`](../../deploy/fl_backend.mk)). Note `make build` does **not** build these — the deploy
compose pulls FL images by tag, so their build definitions live only in [`compose.dev.yml`](./compose.dev.yml).

### Containers run as a non-root user (GHSA-8465)

`fl-server`, `fl-client`, and `fl-base` run as a non-root user created from the `UID`/`GID`/`UNAME` build
args (default `1000`/`1000`/`flip`; the dev compose overrides them with the host user so bind-mounted
provision directories stay writable). Anywhere one of these containers bind-mounts a host path — a
provisioned startup kit, the AWS SSO credential cache — that host path must already be owned by a uid the
container can write, or the entrypoint fails (loudly, since the entrypoint scripts now exit non-zero when
they can't write their generated config). Letting Docker auto-create the bind source leaves it root-owned
and silently breaks the container. See `deploy/providers/AWS/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for the failure mode and
`deploy/providers/AWS/site.yml` / `deploy/providers/local/site_local_trust.yml` for how the provisioning
Ansible pre-creates these paths with the right owner.

**Upgrading an existing environment:** hosts that already ran the previous (root) images may have
root-owned files under the kit's `local/` directory (e.g. `resources.json`, `log_config.json`), written by
the old containers. The non-root entrypoint can't overwrite those in place — a one-time `chown -R` of the
provisioned kit directories to the new container uid is needed before the first non-root run.

### Container capability hardening

The trust-deployment `fl-client-net-*` services (`trust/deploy/compose_trust.{production,development}.nvflare.yml`)
also set `security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]` and `cap_drop: [ALL]`, matching every other trust-side
service. Development adds nothing back: the image is non-root, and Docker makes a `cap_add` effective only
for root, so a grant there would sit unused in the bounding set (`CapEff` stays `0`). A `provision/workspace-dev/`
kit whose ownership doesn't match the image's baked-in UID is fixed by the `chown -R` above, not by a
capability. Production adds back `DAC_OVERRIDE` and `FOWNER`, equally inert for the current non-root image
but retained for legacy root-image compat — a trust pinning a pre-GHSA-8465 `DOCKER_FL_TAG` still runs that
entrypoint as root, and `cap_drop: ALL` would strip the DAC bypass its unguarded kit writes rely on (see
[`deploy/README.md`](../../deploy/README.md#linux-capability-restrictions) for the full rationale). None of
this covers the standalone `fl-services/nvflare/compose.dev.yml` dev harness (`make -C fl-services/nvflare up`),
which remains unhardened — it runs the same non-root image and kit dirs, so it can be hardened the same way
whenever someone picks it up.

## Step-by-step provisioning

### Project yml file

The per-environment project files under [`provision/`](./provision/)
(`net-1_project_dev.yml`, `net-2_project_dev.yml`, `net-1_project_stag.yml`, `net-1_project_prod.yml`)
define the services available within a network. Modify the relevant one if you want to:

- Incorporate further services (e.g. >2 clients)
- Modify GPU resources for the services
- Modify default ports [etc.]

### Net-specific yml file

You can run `make -C fl-services/nvflare provision NET_NUMBER=${NET_NUMBER}` to create a network: this will create an instance of the
services defined in `net-${NET_NUMBER}_project_dev.yml`, substituting the naming by `net-${NET_NUMBER}`.
You can also pass `FL_PORT` if you do not want to use the default (which will be the same for each created net).

### Provisioning command

`make -C fl-services/nvflare provision` wraps the `nvflare provision` CLI. It runs from the
`fl-services/nvflare/fl-api-base` uv project (which declares `nvflare`), so it resolves even though
the repo-root `flip` project has no dependencies. End to end, the target:

1. **Generates the kits.** `nvflare provision` reads the net-specific yml and writes each
   participant's startup kit under `provision/workspace-dev/net-${NET_NUMBER}/prod_XX/`, with default
   names. Each kit has a `local/` and a `startup/` folder; `startup/` holds the start/stop scripts
   (`start.sh`, `sub_start.sh`, `stop_fl.sh`), per-service config (`fed_[service_name].json`), and the
   signature + certificate files. Those certs link the participants together and make the kits
   **non-reusable** across nets.
2. **Moves them into place.** The make target relocates every service into
   `provision/workspace-dev/net-${NET_NUMBER}/services/`.
3. **Adds the runtime code.** Files the `nvflare provision` CLI doesn't emit but the services still
   need (e.g. the Admin API's Python files) are copied in from `fl-base` (server + clients) and
   `fl-api-base` (API).

Once your network is provisioned, you can test it works by bringing the net up standalone (no hub/trusts)
on the local `:dev` images — build them first with `make build-fl` (see [Images](#images-built-in-ci-or-locally-as-dev)):

```sh
make -C fl-services/nvflare up NET_NUMBER=<NET_NUMBER>
```

### Onboarding a new client onto an existing network

The **default** is over-provisioning: stag/prod networks are minted up front with spare
client slots. `make -C fl-services/nvflare provision-stag` / `provision-prod` mint
`Trust_1 .. Trust_N` (default 50 / 500 — see
[FLIP#626](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues/626)). Onboarding a new trust
then just **claims the next unclaimed `Trust_N` kit** via `register_trust` on the hub —
no provisioning step at all, provided the slot name is already in the hub's pool (see
[Activating the new slot on the hub](#activating-the-new-slot-on-the-hub)).

Don't assume the spare pool exists — nets provisioned before FLIP#626 (including the
current prod net-1) carry **no** spare slots. Check what is actually in S3 first:

```sh
aws s3 ls s3://${AICENTRE_BUCKET_NAME}/fl-flare-participant-kits/${FLARE_KIT_DATE}/net-<N>/services/
```

When the spare pool runs dry (or never existed) — or for an ad-hoc dev add — add a
single client **without disrupting the running federation** using the official
`nvflare provision --add_client` flag:

```sh
make -C fl-services/nvflare provision-add-client      NET_NUMBER=1 CLIENT_NAME=Trust_3    # dev
make -C fl-services/nvflare provision-add-client-stag NET_NUMBER=1 CLIENT_NAME=Trust_51   # stag workspace
make -C fl-services/nvflare provision-add-client-prod NET_NUMBER=1 CLIENT_NAME=Trust_501  # prod workspace
```

This reuses the network's existing root CA (loaded from the preserved
`workspace-<env>/net-N/state/`) to sign **only** the new client's kit, and leaves every
already-onboarded participant's kit byte-identical — no re-provision, no CA rotation, no
fleet-wide redeploy. The new kit lands in `workspace-<env>/net-N/services/<CLIENT_NAME>/`.

**One-command path (stag/prod).** `make -C deploy/providers/AWS add-fl-kits N=<n>
PROD=stag|true` runs this whole section end to end. `N` is a target ("ensure N more live
slots"), not a mint count: it discovers the deployment's nets from S3, **activates** up
to `N` existing spares first (env-file edit only — no CA workspace, no certs, no upload),
and for any remaining shortfall restores + fingerprint-verifies each net's CA workspace
and mints the next `Trust_<n>` names on **every** net (slot names are global across nets —
see the hub section below), uploads only the new kits additively. When spares cover `N`
nothing is minted and the CA workspace is never touched. It then appends the activated +
minted names to `FL_KIT_SLOT_NAMES` in the env file and applies the
`/flip/fl_kit_slot_names` SSM parameter (`make apply-fl-kit-slots`) so the slots are
immediately claimable. The manual steps below are what it automates — use them for
unusual cases (custom slot names, a single net).

**Minting vs activating.** A kit existing in S3 and a slot being *claimable* are two
different things: the hub only claims names listed in `FL_KIT_SLOT_NAMES` (via the SSM
parameter). A net provisioned with spare kits therefore has kits no trust can claim, and
those need **activating, not minting** — add the name to `FL_KIT_SLOT_NAMES`, run
`make -C deploy/providers/AWS apply-fl-kit-slots PROD=…`, done (no certs, no upload, no
restart). `add-fl-kits N=<n>` does this for you: it treats `N` as "ensure N more live
slots" and activates up to `N` such spares (lowest-numbered first) before minting the
shortfall, so a good kit is never stranded and, when spares cover `N`, nothing is minted
at all.

**CA-state custody.** The preserved `state/` is the hard prerequisite: it holds the root
CA that signs the new kit. The workspace is gitignored, so it exists only in the checkout
that provisioned (or last added to) the net. `upload-kits-to-s3` mirrors it to S3
alongside the kits, so to add a client from a fresh checkout, restore the CA state and
the server kit (the two things `add-client.sh` checks for) first:

```sh
aws s3 cp s3://${AICENTRE_BUCKET_NAME}/fl-flare-participant-kits/${FLARE_KIT_DATE}/net-<N>/state/ \
  provision/workspace-<env>/net-<N>/state/ --recursive
aws s3 cp s3://${AICENTRE_BUCKET_NAME}/fl-flare-participant-kits/${FLARE_KIT_DATE}/net-<N>/services/fl-server-net-<N>/ \
  provision/workspace-<env>/net-<N>/services/fl-server-net-<N>/ --recursive
```

**Pushing the new kit to S3 (stag/prod).** Upload **additively** — only the new kit, plus
a refresh of `state/cert.json` so the mirrored CA registry records the new identity for
the next add-from-a-fresh-checkout:

```sh
aws s3 cp provision/workspace-<env>/net-<N>/services/<CLIENT_NAME>/ \
  s3://${AICENTRE_BUCKET_NAME}/fl-flare-participant-kits/${FLARE_KIT_DATE}/net-<N>/services/<CLIENT_NAME>/ --recursive
aws s3 cp provision/workspace-<env>/net-<N>/state/cert.json \
  s3://${AICENTRE_BUCKET_NAME}/fl-flare-participant-kits/${FLARE_KIT_DATE}/net-<N>/state/cert.json
```

> ⚠️ Do **not** push a single added kit with `upload-kits-to-s3`. That target runs
> `aws s3 sync --delete` over the **whole** `net-<N>/` prefix, so unless your local
> workspace is a complete, byte-identical copy of everything in S3 (a fresh checkout
> is not), it will **delete or overwrite the live kits of already-onboarded trusts**.
> Reserve it for full (re-)provisions in a maintenance window.

> `make -C fl-services/nvflare provision-prod PROD_NUM_CLIENTS=1000 && make -C fl-services/nvflare upload-kits-to-s3 PROD=true`.

### Activating the new slot on the hub

A kit in S3 is not yet claimable. `register_trust` claims rows from the hub's
`fl_kit_slot` DB pool (`flip_api/db/seed/fl_kit_slots.py` — additive; it never deletes or
re-assigns rows, so existing trust↔slot bindings are safe). One pool row covers **all**
nets — every net carries a kit per slot name, which is why the minting steps above run
per net. The pool is seeded at flip-api boot and **reconciled on demand**: when a
registration finds the pool exhausted, flip-api re-reads the configured slot list,
additively inserts any new names, and retries the claim; only if the pool is still empty
does it fail with `NoFreeKitSlotError: "No FL kit slots available…"`. The configured
list has a single source per environment (`resolve_fl_kit_slot_names`):

- **Dev**: the `FL_KIT_SLOT_NAMES` env var (a `DevSettings`-only field). Add the name to
  `.env.development` and restart flip-api (settings load once per process).
- **Stag/prod (ECS)**: the **`/flip/fl_kit_slot_names` SSM parameter** — the only
  production source (the list is plain configuration, not a secret, and there is
  deliberately no env fallback: a broken or missing parameter means the pool can't grow,
  loudly, rather than silently serving stale env values). Add the name to
  `FL_KIT_SLOT_NAMES` in `.env.stag` / `.env.production` and run
  `make -C deploy/providers/AWS apply-fl-kit-slots PROD=stag|true` — a targeted
  plan/apply of just that parameter, with a plain-text diff you can review. **No
  restart, no task-definition change**: the next registration reconciles the pool from
  the parameter. (`make add-fl-kits` runs this step for you.)

> **The env file must stay a superset of every name ever activated.** Pool rows are
> never deleted, and `add-fl-kits` detects spares purely as *minted-in-S3 on every net
> but absent from `FL_KIT_SLOT_NAMES`* — it cannot see the hub's `fl_kit_slot` table. If
> a previously-activated name drops out of the env file (a restored or hand-edited
> copy), the script "activates" it again: the run reports success, the reconcile inserts
> nothing (the row already exists — possibly assigned to a live trust), and **zero
> claimable capacity is added**, so the next registration still fails with
> `NoFreeKitSlotError`. Treat the `FL_KIT_SLOT_NAMES` list as append-only — `N` means
> "N more live slots" only while that invariant holds.

Then `make register-trust KIT=<CODE>` (see
[Joining as a new trust](../../trust/README.md#joining-as-a-new-trust-dev-hub)) claims the slot — registration writes
the claimed `FL_KIT_SLOT` / `FL_KIT_SLOT_NUMBER` into the trust's kit file, and the
trust-host deploy pulls that kit from the S3 path above.

> Flower caveat: the dynamic path is NVFLARE-only. Flower's per-slot SuperNode key
> labelling reads `TRUST_NAMES` at net startup, so a slot added at runtime isn't usable
> on a running Flower net until its containers are recreated.

## Standalone targets

This backend's [`Makefile`](./Makefile) owns its own `build`/`provision`/`up`/`down`/`submit`. To run
**one provisioned net** on its own — no Central Hub, no trusts — on the local `:dev` images:

```sh
make -C fl-services/nvflare up NET_NUMBER=<N>     # fl-server + fl-api + 2 clients
make -C fl-services/nvflare down                  # tear it down
```

`make -C fl-services/nvflare submit` is **intentionally not wired** for NVFLARE: job submission goes
through the provisioned FLARE admin API, not a simple HTTP POST (unlike Flower's `submit`). To run a
job standalone, use the simulator harness instead:

```sh
make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial TUTORIAL=<name>
```
