# Trust Compose Stack

> **Deploys: trust only.** These files define the trust-side container stack. The Central Hub stack lives in
> [`deploy/`](../../deploy/README.md) at the repo root; infrastructure provisioning (AWS / on-prem / K8s)
> lives in [`deploy/providers/`](../../deploy/providers/README.md).

Do not run these files directly — they are driven by [`trust/Makefile`](../Makefile), which selects the right
combination for the environment, FL backend, GPU availability and kit slot. Start here instead:

```bash
make -C trust up-trust KIT=GSTT              # dev
make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=true  # against a remote hub
```

## File matrix

`trust/Makefile` composes the final `docker compose` invocation from up to **four** of these — base +
backend overlay + GPU + `Trust_1` override, via `up-trust` (and identically `up-fl-clients-kit`). The debug
path is a separate three-file command that never picks up the GPU or `Trust_1` overlays, and
`compose.test.yml` is never combined with any of them. `<env>` is `development` or `production`, selected
by `PROD` (`true`/`stag` → `production`).

| File | Role | When applied |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ |
| `compose_trust.<env>.yml` | **Base stack** — `trust-api`, `imaging-api`, `data-access-api`, `orthanc`, `omop-db`, plus the Loki/Alloy/Grafana observability trio | Always (`COMMON_COMPOSE_FILE`) |
| `compose_trust.<env>.nvflare.yml` | FL client overlay for the NVFLARE backend | Always, backend-selected (`FL_BACKEND_COMPOSE_FILE`) |
| `compose_trust.<env>.flower.yml` | FL client overlay for the Flower backend | Always, backend-selected |
| `compose_trust.<env>.gpu.yml` | NVIDIA device reservation for the fl-client | Only when the kit sets `NUM_AVAILABLE_GPUS > 0` (`GPU_OVERRIDE`). Never applied by `up-trust-ec2` — the EC2 test host is GPU-less |
| `compose_trust-1_override.yml` | Publishes the trust APIs on host ports | Dev only, and only for the trust holding FL slot `Trust_1` (`TRUST_OVERRIDE`) — the override binds one fixed port set, so exactly one trust can claim it |
| `compose_trust.development.debug.override.yml` | debugpy ports + `DEBUG` env on the three APIs | `make debug-trust-api` / `debug-imaging-api` / `debug-data-access-api`. **Dev only** — there is no `production` variant, and the filename is hardcoded rather than `<env>`-interpolated, so these targets do not work under `PROD` |
| `compose.test.yml` | Integration-test stack (`omop-db-test` + `data-access-api-test`) | Testcontainers from pytest, and CI (`test_trust_{trust_api,data_access_api}.yml`). Not part of any `make up` path |

Dev pulls repo-built images from GHCR by default (`pull_policy: always`); `BUILD=true` rebuilds from the
`build:` blocks instead. Production is images-only, with no source bind-mounts.

## Why these live under `trust/`, not `deploy/`

A compose file belongs next to the source tree whose images it builds — the same rule that puts
`fl-services/<backend>/compose.dev.yml` and `trust/xnat/docker-compose-stack.yml` where they are. These files
were deliberately relocated here from `trust/` — one level down, into `trust/deploy/` — in commit
`72c6354b`. They have never lived under the repo-root `deploy/`.

**The relative paths inside them (`./trust-api`, `./observability/`, `./omop-db/volumes/`, …) resolve from
`trust/`, not from this directory.** That works because every caller passes `--project-directory`:

```bash
# trust/Makefile
docker compose --env-file <kit> --project-directory . -f deploy/compose_trust.<env>.yml ...

# trust/<service>/Makefile
docker compose --project-directory .. -f ../deploy/compose_trust.development.yml ...
```

If you ever see a build context that looks wrong by one level, **the fix is the `--project-directory` flag on
the caller, not rewriting `./X` to `../X` in these files.** Rewriting them would break every other caller.

`compose.test.yml` is the one exception: Testcontainers runs it with the context set to `trust/deploy/`, so
its paths are genuinely one level up (`../trust-api`, `../data-access-api`, `../observability`).

## Networks

**Neither the trust stack nor the hub stack creates these networks.** Both declare them `external: true`,
so both *fail* on a missing network rather than creating one. `make -C trust create-networks` is what
creates all of them — the repo-root `make create-networks` forwards to it:

| Network | Created by |
| ------- | ---------- |
| `${TRUST_NETWORK_NAME}` (`deploy_trust-network-<N>`) | `make -C trust create-networks` (`create-networks-trust-1` / `-2`) |
| `central-hub-trust-apis-network` | `make -C trust create-networks` (`create-networks-core`) |
| `deploy_shared-net-1`, `deploy_shared-net-2` | `make -C trust create-networks` (`create-networks-core`) |

So if you hit `network deploy_shared-net-1 declared as external, but could not be found`, the fix is
`make -C trust create-networks` — starting the hub stack cannot help, and a remote trust operator has no
hub compose on the host at all.

The `deploy_` prefix is a historical compose project-name artifact. On the hub side the names are now pinned
explicitly with `name:` (`trust-network-1` → `deploy_trust-network-1`, etc.); the trust side pins only
`default` and relies on the compose key itself as the external network name for the rest (hence the literal
`deploy_shared-net-1` keys). Either way the names are stable regardless of directory layout. Bring the
networks up before the stack — `up-trust` depends on `create-networks` for exactly this reason.
