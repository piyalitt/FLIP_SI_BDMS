# Mock trust setup

Deploy components at the trust level:

* Orthanc ([orthanc](orthanc))
* Imaging API ([imaging-api](imaging-api))
* Data Access API ([data-access-api](data-access-api))
* Trust API ([trust-api](trust-api))
* OMOP Database ([omop-db](omop-db))
* XNAT ([xnat](xnat))

See also the dedicated README files under each folder.

## Setup

### Start Orthanc and trust services

Orthanc, Imaging API, Data Access API and Trust API can be started using the Makefile provided at the repository level:

```sh
make up
```

DICOMs can be uploaded to Orthanc at <http://localhost:8042> — log in with `ORTHANC_USERNAME`/`ORTHANC_PASSWORD` from the trust kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`).

The Trust API polls the Central Hub for tasks. In development, it connects to the hub over HTTP on the internal Docker network.

## Joining as a new trust (dev hub)

Use this flow when you want a trust whose identity (keys, FL kit slot) came from the hub at runtime. The `trust` table on the hub is the sole trust registry — there is no env-slot model. The trust's plaintext keys never live in a hub-side env file; they live only in the trust's gitignored kit file. The Ansible-driven prod flow lives in `docs/source/deploy-flip/deploy-flip-node-on-prem.rst`.

### 1. Register the trust on the hub

A trust is registered on the **running hub** rather than configured via env-file key dicts. The kit files (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`) ARE the roster. Either:

* **`make register-trusts`** (from the repo root) — registers the shipped dev roster (every `trust/.env.*.development.example`, currently GSTT and KCH; run automatically by `make up`), or
* **`make register-trust KIT=<CODE>`** — registers one trust (after `make new-trust TRUST_CODE=<CODE> TRUST_NAME="..."` scaffolds its kit), or
* the **Add Trust** button on the **Connection status** page — enter the friendly name, code, and region. This registers the trust on the hub; to produce a deliverable kit file use the `make register-trust` flow above.

Registration (`register_trust` service, `POST /admin/trusts`):

* mints a `TRUST_API_KEY` and `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` (random tokens),
* stores only the SHA-256 of the API key on `trust.api_key_hash`,
* claims the next free `fl_kit_slot` row and binds it to the new trust id.

`make register-trust` / `register-trusts` are idempotent and write the resulting credentials straight into the per-trust kit file — the hub never stores either plaintext again.

### 2. The per-trust kit file

Each trust stack reads a per-trust kit file `trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>` (e.g. `trust/.env.GSTT.development`, `trust/.env.<CODE>.production`; gitignored; dev templates `trust/.env.<CODE>.development.example` for GSTT/KCH, generic base `trust/.env.example`), auto-included by `trust/Makefile`. `make register-trust KIT=<CODE>` writes the managed blocks. It carries:

```sh
TRUST_API_KEY=<from kit>
TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY=<from kit>
FL_KIT_SLOT=<from kit>
FL_KIT_SLOT_NUMBER=<from kit>
EXPECTED_TRUST_ID=<from kit>
```

plus the trust's identity (`TRUST_NAME` / `TRUST_CODE` / `TRUST_REGION`, read by `register-trust`) and its host-local ports and data directories. The optional `EXPECTED_TRUST_ID` lets trust-api self-check the hub-resolved id at startup.

The kit also carries the trust's **disclosure floor**:

```sh
COHORT_QUERY_THRESHOLD=10
```

This is the minimum cohort size the trust will release anything about. Cohort statistics below it are privacy-suppressed (a genuine zero and a small count are indistinguishable), and both row-level routes refuse outright — `/cohort/dataframe`, which supplies FL training data, and `/cohort/accession-ids`, which decides whose imaging is pulled into XNAT. Raise it to release less. It is the operator's setting, not the hub's: trusts need not agree on a value, and the hub cannot lower it. See [`data-access-api/README.md`](data-access-api/README.md#row-level-data-and-the-disclosure-threshold). The same schema serves dev trusts (GSTT/KCH against a local hub), on-prem trusts (against a prod hub), and laptop-against-prod testing — operator picks the kit code (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`) and `make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=<env>` handles the rest.

#### Site-enforced FL privacy policy (optional, NVFLARE only)

The kit file's Host-local profile can set `FL_SITE_PRIVACY_POLICY=percentile` (plus optional
`FL_SITE_PRIVACY_*` parameters — see the commented block in `trust/.env.example`). The fl-client entrypoint
renders these into the client's NVFLARE `local/privacy.json` at container start, so THIS trust's
update-privacy filter is applied to every outgoing model update regardless of the researcher's app config
(site filters run before app filters and jobs cannot opt out). Unset = no site policy (app-level filters
only, the previous behavior). Invalid values stop the fl-client at startup — fail closed. Apply changes with
`make -C trust up-fl-clients-kit KIT=<CODE>`; the fl-client log then shows
`[site-privacy] site privacy policy ACTIVE: ...`. Details: `docs/source/components/component-fl-nodes.rst`
("Site-enforced privacy policy").

### 3. Start the trust against the hub

```sh
make -C trust down-trust KIT=GSTT   # if a previous GSTT stack is running
make -C trust up-trust KIT=GSTT
```

On an on-prem host provisioned by the local playbook, prefix these with `sudo -E` — the login
user is deliberately not in the docker group (see
[deploy/providers/local/README.md](../deploy/providers/local/README.md)). Dev workstations are
unaffected.

The trust-api container authenticates with its `TRUST_API_KEY` and posts a heartbeat to `POST /trust/heartbeat` (no name segment — the hub resolves the trust's identity from the API key). The Connection status page flips the row online within ~30s.

### Cleanup / lost kit

The plaintext keys aren't recoverable — only the hash is on disk. If you didn't save the kit, the only options are:

* delete the row (`DELETE FROM trust WHERE name='<name>';` against `flip-db`, after freeing the slot: `UPDATE fl_kit_slot SET assigned_to_trust_id = NULL, assigned_at = NULL WHERE assigned_to_trust_id = '<trust-id>';`) and re-register, or
* re-register with `make register-trust KIT=<CODE>`, which mints fresh keys and rewrites the kit file — this also rotates the keys.

## OMOP Database

See dedicated README under [omop-db/README.md](omop-db/README.md) for instructions to populate the database.

## XNAT

`make up` (and `make up-trust KIT=<name>`) brings up that trust's XNAT automatically — it is no longer a separate step. See the dedicated README under [xnat/README.md](xnat/README.md) for standalone XNAT management and debugging.

## Running standalone (remote trust operator)

If you are operating a trust on a host that does not have the hub's
`.env.<env>` file (e.g. an on-prem deployment or a third-party trust), you
need only your trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`).

### One-time setup

1. The hub admin scaffolds and registers your kit
   (`make new-trust TRUST_CODE=<CODE> TRUST_NAME="..." PROD=true`
   then `make register-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=true`). The result is a complete
   kit file at `trust/.env.<CODE>.production` containing credentials, the AES
   key, the hub URL, image tags, and a host-local profile.
2. The hub admin transmits the file to you out-of-band (SCP-via-SSM for an
   EC2 trust; encrypted channel for on-prem).
3. Drop it at `trust/.env.<CODE>.production` in your checkout.
4. Fill in the **Trust-local credentials** block (Orthanc / OMOP / XNAT /
   Grafana passwords) — these are your secrets, the hub never sees them.
5. Start the stack:
   - EC2 trust: `make -C trust up-trust-ec2 KIT=<CODE> PROD=true`
   - On-prem trust: `sudo -E env PROD=true make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE>`
     (sudo: the provisioned login user is deliberately not in the docker group;
     `-E` keeps `$HOME` so root's docker reuses your GHCR login)
   - Laptop-against-prod: `make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=true` (no sudo —
     your workstation isn't provisioned by the on-prem playbook)

   The on-prem path skips the dev-only `update-omop-data` / `update-orthanc-data`
   steps (which pull test fixtures from S3 and need hub AWS credentials) —
   real on-prem operators populate `./omop-db/volumes/<CODE>/db_data` and
   `./orthanc/orthanc-storage-<…>` themselves.

### Refreshing shared values (when the hub admin rotates an AES key etc.)

When the hub admin rotates a shared value (AES key, FL backend, image tag),
they will run `make sync-trust-kit KIT=<CODE> PROD=true` on their side. That
produces an updated kit file with the new Hub-shared block; credentials are
preserved. The updated file is transmitted to you using the same out-of-band
channel. Replace your local copy and restart the stack:

```bash
make -C trust restart-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=true
```

## Integration tests (cohort-query end-to-end)

The `trust-api` and `data-access-api` integration suites run against a throwaway Compose stack — vanilla Postgres seeded from a small OMOP fixture plus a freshly-built `data-access-api`. The stack is defined in [`deploy/compose.test.yml`](deploy/compose.test.yml) and brought up by [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers-python.readthedocs.io/) inside session-scoped pytest fixtures, so a single test invocation is enough — no `make up` first.

```sh
# trust-api: drives ``handle_cohort_query`` end-to-end through trust-api → data-access-api → omop-db
make -C trust-api integration_test

# data-access-api: hits ``/cohort`` endpoints directly against the same stack
make -C data-access-api integration_test
```

The seed data lives in [`trust-api/tests/integration/fixtures/omop_seed.sql`](trust-api/tests/integration/fixtures/omop_seed.sql) and follows the MI-CDM shape — `image_occurrence` joined to `concept` for modality lookups. Counts there match the assertions in `test_cohort_query.py` and `test_cohort_endpoint.py` (16 patients, 24 image occurrences). When adjusting the seed, update both. The trust-api side mocks nothing on the HTTP boundary — the only stub is an in-process HTTP server that catches the trust-api → flip-api callback (B3 is intentionally scoped to exclude the hub leg, see issue #369).

Both Make targets are also wired into CI via dedicated jobs in `test_trust_trust_api.yml` and `test_trust_data_access_api.yml`.
