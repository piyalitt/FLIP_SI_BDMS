# AGENTS.md — Trust Services

## Re-read the user prompt (user standing instruction)

YOU MUST READ MY PROMPT AGAIN AND CHECK ALL THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY GET WHAT I WANT IN THE PROMPT.

Before planning, before the first tool call, and again before you finish:
1. Re-read the current user prompt in full. Do not rely on a remembered summary.
2. Check every requirement, constraint, example, exclusion, path, format, and success criterion the prompt actually contains.
3. Confirm the work matches that list with nothing missing, substituted, or silently dropped. If anything is still unclear or blocked, ask once for that blocker only.

## Architecture

Trust services run at each healthcare institution (cloud EC2 or on-prem). All trust communication is outbound — trusts poll the Central Hub; no inbound ports needed.

| Service | Port | Purpose |
| --------- | ------ | --------- |
| trust-api | 8020 | API gateway, polls hub for tasks, orchestrates trust |
| imaging-api | 8001 | DICOM image retrieval from PACS |
| data-access-api | 8010 | OMOP database queries for cohort analysis |
| fl-client | — | FL participant (connects outbound to FL server via NLB) |
| omop-db | 5432 | Mocked OMOP patient database (PostgreSQL); dir also holds the image build source + populate tooling (#834, see `omop-db/AGENTS.md`) |
| orthanc | 8042 | Mocked DICOM PACS server (UI/REST behind HTTP basic auth — kit file's `ORTHANC_USERNAME`/`ORTHANC_PASSWORD`; DICOM port 4242 is internal to the trust network and not bound to the host) |
| xnat | 8104 | Mocked neuroimaging platform |
| observability | 3000/3100 | Grafana + Loki monitoring stack |

## Kit file structure

Each `trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>` carries the trust's host-local profile,
trust-local credentials, and kit credentials. **Hub-shared vars have one source
per environment** — there is no copy to drift:

- **Dev:** the kit's Hub-shared block is **commented out** (inert). The values
  are inherited from the hub's `.env.development` (the single source) —
  `trust/Makefile` `-include`s it (dev only) and the root `make up` also exports
  it. So you edit a hub-shared var (e.g. `DOCKER_FL_TAG`, `AES_KEY_BASE64`) in
  `.env.development` and `make up`; no re-register, no stale kit copy.
- **Prod:** the kit carries the Hub-shared block **live** — a remote operator
  has no hub `.env`, so the kit is their only source. `trust/Makefile` stays
  kit-only in prod (no hub `.env` include); a stale/missing value fails loud.

Four sections, in order (the dev `.env.<CODE>.development.example` templates show
the commented dev form):

| Section | Owner | Touched by |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Host-local profile | Operator | hand-edit (ports, bind dirs, optional `FL_SITE_PRIVACY_*` site privacy policy) |
| Trust-local credentials | Operator | hand-edit (passwords, service URLs) |
| Hub-shared (managed) | Hub admin | `register-trust KIT=<CODE>` (live in prod, commented in dev) / `sync-trust-kit KIT=<CODE>` (prod refresh) |
| Kit credentials (managed) | Hub | `register-trust` only — write-once; hub keeps only the hash |

The Hub-shared block is delimited by a sentinel comment
(`# ── Hub-shared (managed by register-trust / sync-trust-kits — do not edit) ──`)
that `scripts/distribute_trust_kits.py` and `scripts/sync_trust_kit.py`
match byte-for-byte. The exact key set is the `HUB_SHARED_ENV_KEYS` tuple in
`flip_api/scripts/register_trust.py` (`AES_KEY_BASE64`,
`CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL`, `TRUST_API_KEY_HEADER`, `FL_BACKEND`,
`FLOWER_KIT_DATE`, `FLARE_KIT_DATE`, `DOCKER_TAG`, `DOCKER_REGISTRY`,
`DOCKER_FL_TAG`, `DOCKER_FL_REGISTRY`, `NLB_SUBDOMAIN`, `FL_SERVER_PORT`).
`UPLOADED_FEDERATED_DATA_BUCKET` is hub-only (fl-server uploads aggregated
results to S3); `DOCKER_FL_CLIENT_NAME` is derived from `FL_BACKEND` by
`deploy/fl_backend.mk` (trust/Makefile includes it).

`make sync-trust-kit KIT=<CODE> PROD=<env>` refreshes the Hub-shared block in
`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>` from the admin's local `$(MAIN_ENV_FILE)` without
rotating credentials. Implemented by `scripts/sync_trust_kit.py` (uv
PEP 723 script — stdlib only, no docker/jq/ECS round-trip). Works
identically across dev/stag/prod — the root Makefile's `include
$(MAIN_ENV_FILE)` + `export` populates os.environ before the script
runs, so `PROD=true` simply selects which env file to read. Run after
rotating `AES_KEY_BASE64`, bumping `DOCKER_TAG`, switching `FL_BACKEND`,
etc., then re-transmit the refreshed kit file to the remote operator
(out-of-band, same as initial distribution — SCP-via-SSM for EC2;
encrypted channel for on-prem).

For the on-prem flow, the admin scaffolds and fills the kit on their
workstation in two commands (prod AWS creds required):

1. `make new-trust TRUST_CODE=<CODE> TRUST_NAME="..." PROD=true`
   — scaffolds `trust/.env.<CODE>.production` from the base template
   (`trust/.env.example`).
2. `make register-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=true` — registers on the prod hub and
   fills BOTH the Kit credentials AND the Hub-shared block in one step
   (replaces the old "paste 5 UI lines + separate `sync-trust-kit`").

Then `make -C deploy/providers/AWS package-onprem-trust-kit KIT=<CODE> PROD=true`
tarballs the populated kit file as-is + the operator's slice of the FL
participant kit S3 bucket into
`deploy/providers/AWS/build/trust-kits/flip-trust-kit-<slot>-<date>.tar.gz`.
The packager does NOT edit the kit file.

The operator extracts, copies `.env.<CODE>.production` into their checkout,
edits only the Host-local profile (sets `FL_KIT_DIR`, ports/dirs) and rotates
the Trust-local passwords, runs `sudo -E make onboard-onprem-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=true`
for the readiness checklist (kit present, swarm active — the swarm check queries
the docker daemon, hence sudo; Hub-shared + Kit credentials populated, FL_KIT_DIR
exists + has the expected files), then `sudo -E make up-onprem-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=true`.
Sudo because the provisioned login user is deliberately not in the docker group
(root-equivalent); `-E` preserves `$HOME` so root's docker reuses the operator's
GHCR login from `~/.docker/config.json`.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Makefile` | Trust stack orchestration (parameterized `up-trust KIT=<name>`) |
| `deploy/README.md` | Compose file matrix, the `--project-directory` rule these files depend on, and the external networks they join |
| `deploy/compose_trust.development.yml` | Dev Docker Compose (pulls repo-built services from GHCR by default via `pull_policy: always`; `BUILD=true` rebuilds from the `build:` block instead) |
| `deploy/compose_trust.production.yml` | Prod Docker Compose (GHCR images; declares the `trust-local-{loki,grafana}-data` named volumes as defaults) |
| `deploy/compose_trust.{env}.{flower\|nvflare}.yml` | FL backend variants |
| `deploy/compose_trust.{env}.gpu.yml` | GPU passthrough overlay — added by `up-trust` / `up-fl-clients-kit` via `GPU_OVERRIDE` only when the kit's `NUM_AVAILABLE_GPUS > 0`; reserves host NVIDIA GPU(s) for the fl-client. `up-trust-ec2` never applies it (the EC2 t3.xlarge is GPU-less, so the fl-client is CPU-only there regardless of the kit) |
| `deploy/compose_trust-1_override.yml` | Dev trust-1 host-port bindings |
| `.env.<CODE>.<env>` | Per-trust kit file, e.g. `.env.GSTT.development`, `.env.<CODE>.production` (TRUST_API_KEY, TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY, FL_KIT_SLOT, FL_KIT_SLOT_NUMBER, EXPECTED_TRUST_ID, host-local ports/dirs, **FL_KIT_DIR** — root of the FL participant kit, default `/opt/flip/fl-kit` matching the Ansible-staged EC2 path); gitignored. Templates: per-trust dev examples `.env.GSTT.development.example` / `.env.KCH.development.example`; the generic scaffold base `.env.example`, consumed by `make new-trust`. Same kit-file schema everywhere — `make -C trust up-trust KIT=<CODE> PROD=<env>` is the only dispatch |

```

## Environment

- All runtime config comes from the kit file (`trust/.env.<KIT>`); no hub `.env.*` is included by `trust/Makefile` or `trust/xnat/Makefile`. `PROD` still selects the compose-file suffix (development / production) but no longer drives an env-file include.
- Trust identity: `TRUST_API_KEY` (per-trust, from the kit file `trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`); optional `EXPECTED_TRUST_ID` self-check. The hub identifies the trust by API key alone.
- Encryption: `AES_KEY_BASE64` for trust-to-hub payload encryption (hub-shared; synced into the kit file).
- `DEBUG` is no longer inherited from a hub env file. `make debug` / `make debug-off` set it explicitly; `make up-trust` without an explicit `DEBUG=true` runs services in non-debug mode.
- Site-enforced FL privacy policy (NVFLARE only, FLIP#851): `FL_SITE_PRIVACY_POLICY=percentile` (+ optional `FL_SITE_PRIVACY_*` params, see `trust/.env.example`) in the kit's Host-local profile. Rendered into the fl-client's NVFLARE `local/privacy.json` at container start by `python -m flip.nvflare.site_policy` — composes on top of (runs before) any app-level filter, jobs can't opt out, invalid values fail the fl-client closed. Unset = no site policy (previous behavior). Apply with `make -C trust up-fl-clients-kit KIT=<CODE>`.
- The two shipped dev trusts (GSTT, KCH) have separate ports, networks, and data dirs. Their FL kit *slots* are still named `Trust_1` / `Trust_2` — those are the pre-provisioned FL participant-kit identities (cert CN for NVFLARE, supernode number for Flower), assigned to a trust by the hub at registration. A trust (GSTT) claims a slot (Trust_1); they are different things.
- Local trust uses `trust-local` project name to avoid port collisions
