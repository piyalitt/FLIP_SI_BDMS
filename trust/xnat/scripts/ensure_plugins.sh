# Script to ensure required XNAT plugins are present in the local plugin directory.
# If any required plugin families are missing, it attempts to sync them from the specified S3 bucket.
# If they are already present, it skips the S3 sync command, so it does not rely on S3 access if the plugins are already available locally.
# Usage: ./ensure_plugins.sh <plugin_dir> <s3_bucket> [s3_prefix]
# s3_prefix defaults to the legacy flat layout (xnat/plugins); callers pass the version-keyed
# prefix (xnat-<version>/plugins) so each XNAT version keeps its own plugin roster in S3 and
# branches on different XNAT versions can coexist.
#
# The presence check below matches plugin *families* by filename prefix, not versions — the
# version roster is whatever the S3 prefix holds. So the prefix each sync came from is recorded
# in a stamp file, and a mismatch (or no stamp: jars cached before the version-keyed layout)
# forces a re-sync whose --delete clears the stale versions. Without this, a checkout that
# changes XNAT version would accept a developer's previously-cached jars and silently bake the
# old, incompatible plugin versions into the new image.
