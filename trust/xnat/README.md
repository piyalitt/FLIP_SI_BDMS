# XNAT

XNAT is the medical imaging archive used by each FLIP trust site. It stores DICOM data imported from the trust's PACS (Orthanc) and makes it available to federated learning pipelines via the Imaging API. This directory contains the Docker configuration for running XNAT locally and on EC2, along with the plugins and setup scripts needed to integrate it with the rest of the FLIP Trust Services layer.

## Version notes (XNAT 1.10.0)

FLIP runs XNAT `1.10.0` (see `XNAT_VERSION` in `.env`). Two things matter for us:

- **JDK 21.** 1.10.0 moves from JDK 8 to JDK 21 (for long-term support), so the image's Tomcat base
  moved to a `jdk21` variant. Upstream states there is **no change in the Tomcat or PostgreSQL
  version requirements**, which is why Tomcat stays on 9.x and `PG_VERSION` stays at `12.2-alpine`.
  Most JDK 8-compiled plugins still run — see [Plugin compatibility](#plugin-compatibility) below.
- **dcm4che2 → dcm4che5.** XNAT's core DICOM processing library was replaced. This is what forces the
  DQR plugin upgrade, and it is the change most likely to alter DICOM import behaviour, so the import
  path (Orthanc → DQR → directArchive → NIfTI conversion) deserves a full re-test on 1.10. The
  release also notes mitigations for imports of very large (>2 GB) uncompressed DICOM files.
  *Re-tested live on the dev stack (2026-07-30, both trusts): imaging-api project create → DQR 3.0.0
  query + import → C-MOVE from Orthanc → directArchive → Container Service dcm2niix → NIfTI resource,
  with `import_status_count` reporting the queued → processing → successful lifecycle correctly.*
- **`siteUrl` must be set (1.10.0 regression for headless installs).** The Restlet create paths
  (e.g. `POST /data/projects`, used by imaging-api) resolve response references through the `siteUrl`
  site preference via `URI.create()`, which throws an uncaught NPE when the preference is null — the
  entity is created but the request returns 500 (`SecureResource -
  NullPointerException ... "this.input" is null` in `restlet.log`), so imaging-api treats every
  project create as failed while orphan projects accumulate in XNAT. The UI setup wizard always sets
  `siteUrl`; our headless `configure-xnat.sh` (and the K8s init job) now set it explicitly during
  activation. On 1.9.3 a null `siteUrl` fell into a caught `MalformedURLException` path, which is why
  this never bit before.
- **Dynamic Data Types.** 1.10.0 adds real-time creation of data types and management of display
  fields — XSD additions without plugin development and without a Tomcat restart.

> **This does not supersede the FLIP#612 fix.** Cohort imports of chest X-rays once reported a
> permanent "0 imported" because `xnat:dxSessionData` is not in XNAT's default *secure element* set
> (`cr/ct/mr/pet/petmr`), and the project-scoped experiment listing filters on element-access rows.
> That data type already exists in the XSD — the gap was **element-security registration**, not a
> missing type — so Dynamic Data Types does not address it. imaging-api reads the unfiltered global
> listing (`GET /data/experiments?project={id}`) instead, which is modality-agnostic and needs no
> registration; keep it that way. See `imaging_api/services/projects.py::get_experiments`.

## Docker Swarm

XNAT is deployed using Docker Swarm (both locally and on EC2). This is because Swarm provides overlay networking, resource constraints, and restart policies needed for XNAT services.

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker Swarm must be initialized before running XNAT: `docker swarm init`
- Overlay networks are created automatically by Make targets

**How it works:**

- `make up` / `make down` use `docker stack deploy` / `docker stack rm` under the hood
- The stack definition uses layered compose files, selected by the `PROD` variable:

  | Environment | Files |
  | --- | --- |
  | Development (default) | `docker-compose-stack.yml` + `docker-compose-stack.development.yml` |
  | Staging / Production | `docker-compose-stack.yml` + `docker-compose-stack.production.yml` |

  The base file defines the three services (`xnat-web`, `xnat-db`, `xnat-nginx`). The development overlay adds host bind-mounts for hot-reload and resource limits sized for dev machines. The production overlay mounts persistent data volumes under `/opt/flip/xnat/`.
- Two XNAT instances are deployed as separate Swarm stacks (`xnat1`, `xnat2`), one per trust
- **Every redeploy is a fresh install.** `up-xnat` blocks on `down-xnat` and then runs `xnat-reset`,
  which `rm -rf`s `XNAT_DATA_DIR` and recreates it — in development *and* in staging/production
  (local Docker context or remote-over-ssh alike). So `configure-xnat.sh` always runs against a
  brand-new instance and re-applies the full site configuration; its `initialized=true`
  short-circuit is there for a re-run against a *live* instance, not for an upgrade. If an in-place
  upgrade of a persistent XNAT is ever supported outside this tooling, that short-circuit would skip
  re-applying site config (`siteUrl`, DQR access control) and would need revisiting.

## Setup

Note you need Orthanc running in order to startup XNAT and configure it properly (see [orthanc](../orthanc/)).

### Build XNAT Docker images for local development

Build the XNAT Docker images locally (requires AWS CLI access for S3 artifacts):

```sh
make build
```

This downloads the XNAT WAR and plugins from S3, then builds all three images (`xnat-web`, `xnat-db`, `xnat-nginx`) tagged as `${DOCKER_REGISTRY}xnat-<service>:${DOCKER_TAG}`.

### Run XNAT

Run both configured development XNAT instances with:

```sh
make up
```

`make up` validates the local plugin cache first, creates the required data directories, deploys the XNAT stack via
Docker Swarm, and automatically configures both XNAT instances (service account, admin password, SCP receiver, PACS
registration, dcm2niix command). The repo-root `make up` follows the same path after registering the example Trusts.

Every configuration call is checked: a rejected XNAT API call (non-2xx) aborts the deploy with the failing request's
HTTP status and response body (see `configure-xnat-<stack>.log` inside the container), instead of silently skipping
that step. Configuration waits up to 15 minutes for an authenticated DQR plugin endpoint, rather than treating the
earlier Tomcat login page as proof that plugins are ready. Re-running against an already-configured instance is
tolerated — the existing service account, PACS registration, and availability intervals are detected and left as-is.

In development (when `PROD` is not set), `make up` also mounts the local `xnat/plugins` and `xnat/config` directories into the container for hot-reload. In production, these are baked into the Docker image.

> **Important — XNAT data volumes must be bind-mounted.**
> XNAT's container service plugin executes Docker commands on the host (via the mounted Docker socket). Those host-spawned containers need access to XNAT data through host paths, so the data directories (`archive`, `build`, `cache`, `tomcat_logs`) must be bind-mounted rather than using named volumes. The `/${XNAT_PORT}` prefix isolates data directories per XNAT instance. See `docker-compose-stack.development.yml` for the full volume configuration.

If successful, you will be able to log in to XNAT with the service account credentials (specified in the trust's kit file, `trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`) and see the registered PACS in the DICOM Query-Retrieve plugin.

## Plugins

Plugins and the XNAT WAR are stored in S3 as a **version-keyed artifact set**:
`s3://<FLIP_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME>/xnat-<version>/xnat-web-<version>.war` plus
`.../xnat-<version>/plugins/*.jar` (e.g. `xnat-1.10.0/`). Each XNAT version needs a matching plugin
roster, and keying the whole set by version lets branches on different XNAT versions (e.g. `main` vs
`develop` across an upgrade) build without clobbering each other. The CI workflows and
`make build` download the set for the `XNAT_VERSION` in `.env` and bake it into the Docker image.

Development additionally bind-mounts the gitignored `xnat/plugins/` directory over the image's plugins. Therefore a
fresh checkout must set `FLIP_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME` to a real bucket (the shipped `<your-...>` placeholder is
rejected) and have AWS access for its first start. `make up` runs `xnat-plugins-download` before stopping any existing
XNAT: a complete cache stamped with the current versioned S3 prefix skips AWS, while a missing or mismatched cache is
downloaded and revalidated. A failed download leaves the currently running XNAT untouched.

That automatic fill is **development-only**, because only the development stack mounts the directory. On stag, prod,
EC2 and on-prem, `make up` neither needs nor fetches the host cache — those stacks run the plugins baked in at image
build, which is where `make build` (above) puts them. An operator who wants a host-side cache there anyway — to
inspect the jars, or to build offline later — populates it explicitly with
`make -C trust/xnat xnat-plugins-download`, which needs `FLIP_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME` and AWS access.

> The pre-1.10 flat layout (`xnat/xnat-web-1.9.3.war` + `xnat/plugins/`) is kept as-is while `main`
> still builds 1.9.3; delete it once this upgrade reaches `main`.

### Plugin compatibility

Make sure to always use the correct version of the plugins that are compatible with the XNAT version specified. Check the plugin's compatibility matrix for more information (for example, see [DQR Plugin Compatibility Matrix](https://wiki.xnat.org/xnat-tools/dqr-plugin-compatibility-matrix)).

**A JDK 8-compiled plugin is not automatically broken on 1.10.** Per the XNAT 1.10.0 release
announcement, 1.10.0 runs most JDK 8-era plugins as-is; only plugins that depend on components XNAT
itself updated (notably the `dcm4che2` → `dcm4che5` DICOM library swap) need a new build. This
upgrade changes two plugins for FLIP: DQR (forced by `dcm4che5`) and Container Service (the
[CS compatibility matrix](https://wiki.xnat.org/container-service/container-service-compatibility-matrix)
ticks **only 3.8.x** for XNAT 1.10.0 — 3.7.x support stops at 1.9.3.x, even though 3.7.3 happened to
pass a basic conversion smoke on 1.10.0).

The following table lists the plugin versions for the XNAT version `1.10.0` used in this environment.

| Plugin                          | Version for XNAT 1.10.0     | Installed | Action for the 1.10 upgrade |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| DICOM Query-Retrieve Plugin     | 3.0.0                       | Yes       | **Must upgrade** from 2.2.0 — rebuilt on JDK 21 + `dcm4che5`, plus a thread-leakage fix |
| Container Service Plugin        | 3.8.1 (JDK 8 build)         | Yes       | **Must upgrade** from 3.7.3 — 3.8.x is the only column the compatibility matrix ticks for 1.10.0 |
| Batch Launch Plugin             | 0.9.0 (JDK 8 build)         | Yes       | None — the matrix keeps BLP 0.9.0 for 1.10.0 |
| OHIF Viewer Plugin              | 3.8.0 available; n/a here   | No        | None — deliberately not installed (FLIP#662) |

Not applicable to FLIP, but released alongside 1.10.0: **Distributed Events 2.0.0** (only needed for
load-balanced multi-node XNAT — each FLIP trust runs a single node) and **MFA 1.6.0** (FLIP does not
use XNAT-side MFA; hub auth is Cognito and imaging-api authenticates as a service account).

> **DQR 3.0.0 is a major version bump and imaging-api reads DQR's tables directly.**
> `imaging_api/db/get_{queued,executed}_pacs_request_by_project.py` query DQR's Hibernate tables
> (`xhbm_queued_pacs_request`, `xhbm_executed_pacs_request`) and `services/retrieval.py` compares
> against the literal status `"FAILED"`. A major bump carrying a `dcm4che5` rewrite could change
> table columns or status vocabulary, which would silently misreport in-flight and failed imports.
> **Verified compatible (2026-07-30):** the released 3.0.0 JAR keeps
> `PacsRequest.FAILED_STATUS_TEXT == "FAILED"` (full vocabulary
> QUEUED/PROCESSING/ISSUED/RECEIVED/FAILED), and the `xhbm_*_pacs_request` columns imaging-api reads
> were confirmed unchanged on a live 3.0.0 instance during the dev-stack smoke test.
>
> The DQR thread-leakage fix is also worth attention: it is plausibly related to the bulk-import
> wedging investigated in FLIP#662 (worked around here with the raised heap in `.env` and by
> excluding the OHIF viewer). Re-test a large cohort pull on 1.10 + DQR 3.0.0 before assuming those
> workarounds are still needed.

**Staying on 1.9 instead?** Upstream also shipped **XNAT 1.9.3.4** (urgent fixes for JDK 8
deployments) and **DQR 2.3.2** (the thread-leak fix alone, JDK 8). That is the lower-risk path to the
DQR fix if this 1.10 upgrade stalls.

The `xnat-1.10.0/` artifact set (WAR + DQR 3.0.0 + Container Service 3.8.1 + Batch Launch 0.9.0) is
uploaded and CI-verified. All three upgraded artifacts are public downloads, no account needed:
the WAR from `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/xnatdev/xnat-web/downloads/xnat-web-1.10.0.war`,
DQR from
`https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/xnatdev/dicom-query-retrieve/downloads/dicom-query-retrieve-3.0.0-xpl.jar`
(the same repo also carries `2.3.2`/`2.4.0` for the JDK 8 fallback), and CS from
`https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/download/3.8.1/container-service-3.8.1-fat.jar`.
Local builds skip S3 when the files already sit in `xnat/build-artifacts/` and `xnat/plugins/`.

### Adding or updating a plugin

1. Upload the new `.jar` file to `s3://<FLIP_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME>/xnat-<version>/plugins/` for the
   XNAT version it targets (removing the JAR it replaces — the sync bakes every JAR in the prefix).
2. Update the plugin compatibility table above.
3. Trigger the CI workflows (push or `gh workflow run`) to rebuild the image with the new plugin.

## Importing data

Use the Imaging API to import data from Orthanc to XNAT.

This can also be done manually from XNAT:

- At the top of the homepage, select the **Browse > All Projects** tab.
- Open your project.
- Click on **Import from PACS** on the right-hand sidebar.
- Select **Orthanc** as your **Source PACS** (the selected SCP Receiver should default to **XNAT:8104**).
- [Query PACS](https://wiki.xnat.org/xnat-tools/using-dqr-searching-the-pacs-and-importing-data#UsingDQR:SearchingthePACSandImportingData-Querying/SearchingforImageSessions).

## DICOM Anonymization

XNAT includes a built-in anonymization engine that processes incoming DICOM data to remove Protected Health Information (PHI) from DICOM headers. FLIP replaces the default XNAT anonymization script with a comprehensive site-wide script (`anon_script.das`) that removes patient identifiers, institutional identifiers, physician/operator identifiers, and pseudonymizes UIDs (including Patient ID, Patient Name and SOP/Study/Series Instance UIDs).

The anonymization script is configured automatically during XNAT initialization via `configure-xnat.sh`. It is applied to all incoming DICOM data when the SCP receiver has `anonymizationEnabled` set to `true`.

The script is covered by an automated test pack in [`tests/`](./tests/) which parses `anon_script.das`, applies the rules to a synthetic DICOM study populated with PHI in every targeted tag, and asserts the resulting dataset is clean. Run with `make unit_test` from this directory or `make -C tests unit_test`. Update `PHI_TAGS_REQUIRED` in `tests/test_anon_script_static.py` whenever you change the script's PHI coverage.

## DICOM to NIfTI Conversion

XNAT uses two mechanisms for dcm2niix conversion:

- **Command** (Container Service): The dcm2niix command is registered and enabled **site-wide** during initial XNAT setup (`configure-dcm2niix.sh`). This makes it available for manual use from the XNAT UI in any project.
- **Event Subscription** (Event Service): Per-project event subscriptions auto-trigger dcm2niix when DICOM scans are uploaded. These are created by the **Imaging API** during FLIP project creation, controlled by the `dicom_to_nifti` project setting.

The setup script (`configure-dcm2niix.sh`) intentionally does **not** create a site-wide event subscription. This ensures dcm2niix only auto-triggers for projects that have opted in via the `dicom_to_nifti` flag.

## Resource limits

XNAT's container service plugin can launch many containers simultaneously (e.g. multiple dcm2niix conversions during a large import). Without resource limits, this can exhaust host CPU and memory, causing XNAT itself to hang. Docker Swarm's deploy resource constraints (`reservations` and `limits`) prevent this by capping what each service can consume.

The development overlay (`docker-compose-stack.development.yml`) sets these constraints for `xnat-web` and `xnat-db`. EC2 deployments should also set limits, but the current instance type may be too small for the development values — adjust them to match the available resources on your target instance.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing plugins or an S3/AWS error before startup** — confirm `FLIP_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME`, renew the selected AWS
  SSO session, then run `make -C trust/xnat xnat-plugins-download` from the repository root. The command must find the
  batch-launch, container-service, and DICOM Query-Retrieve plugin families before startup can continue.

- **XNAT serves its login page but configuration reports plugin-route 404s** — inspect
  `configure-xnat-<stack>.log` in the container. Once the plugin cache is repaired, rerun the individual Trust with
  `make -C trust/xnat up-xnat KIT=<CODE>`. This target intentionally resets that development XNAT's data. If the
  running instance already has the correct plugins and only configuration needs retrying, use
  `make -C trust/xnat xnat-configure XNAT_PROJECT=xnat<N>` instead.

- **"Error: Cannot import" when importing studies from PACS** — The DICOM SCP Receiver was missing the correct identifier. Fix: set the identifier to `dqrObjectIdentifier` and enable custom processing under **Administer > Site Administration > DICOM SCP Receivers > XNAT**. Now handled automatically by `make up`.

- **`DockerRequestException` on container launch** — Container service plugin 3.4.3 is incompatible with Docker 25+ ([known issue](https://groups.google.com/g/xnat_discussion/c/2kh3J-p_8bE), [3.5.0 release notes](https://bitbucket.org/xnatdev/container-service/src/master/CHANGELOG.md)). Fixed by upgrading the plugin to 3.6.2+ and XNAT to 1.9.3 (see [compatibility matrix](https://wiki.xnat.org/container-service/container-service-compatibility-matrix#ContainerServiceCompatibilityMatrix-ContainerServiceCompatibilitywithXNAT)). Batch Launch and DQR plugins were also updated.

- **Container can't find data** — Path translation between the XNAT container and host was not configured. Now set automatically during `make up`.
