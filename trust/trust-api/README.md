The **trust-api** is the gateway service deployed at each participating healthcare Trust site. It polls the FLIP
Central Hub for tasks and coordinates local operations — cohort queries, model training, and imaging project
management — without exposing patient data externally.

## Role in the FLIP Platform

The trust-api acts as the local orchestrator at each Trust:

1. **Cohort queries** — polls for and executes OMOP SQL queries from the Central Hub, delegates to [data-access-api](../data-access-api/), and returns aggregated statistics
2. **Imaging projects** — creates projects in XNAT via [imaging-api](../imaging-api/) in response to approved FL studies
3. **Service health** — a background collector probes the trust stack every `HEALTH_COLLECT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (imaging-api + data-access-api `/health`, XNAT via its anonymous `buildInfo` endpoint, the PACS connector transitively via imaging-api's `ping_pacs` DIMSE echo, the OMOP database via a raw TCP connect) and attaches the snapshot to the heartbeat; the hub surfaces it on the Connection Status page's per-container drawer
4. **Audit** — logs all operations locally for governance purposes

The trust-api polls the [flip-api](../../flip-api/) (Central Hub) for tasks. It does not accept inbound requests from the hub or expose an external user interface.

## Deployment

The trust-api is deployed as part of the Trust-side stack. In the local test environment it starts as part of:

```bash
make up-trusts   # trust services for both mock Trusts
```

or the full stack:

```bash
make up
```

API documentation (Swagger UI) is available at the port defined by `TRUST_API_PORT` in this
trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`; templates: `trust/.env.GSTT.development.example`,
`trust/.env.KCH.development.example`, default `8020`):

```
http://localhost:<TRUST_API_PORT>/docs
```

## Configuration

Key environment variables. Per-trust values (ports, keys, expected trust id) live in this
trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`); hub-shared values (`AES_KEY_BASE64`,
`CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL`) are synced into the kit's Hub-shared block by
`make register-trust KIT=<CODE>` (live in prod, inherited from the hub `.env.<env>` in dev):

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EXPECTED_TRUST_ID` | Optional self-check. If set, trust-api aborts at startup when the hub-resolved trust id does not match this value |
| `DATA_ACCESS_API_URL` | Internal URL of the data-access-api |
| `IMAGING_API_URL` | Internal URL of the imaging-api |
| `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` | URL of the Central Hub API (for task polling) |
| `TRUST_API_KEY` | Per-trust API key for authenticating with the Central Hub. Lives in this trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`), written by `make register-trust KIT=<CODE>` |
| `AES_KEY_BASE64` | Base64-encoded AES-256 key shared with the hub, used to decrypt encrypted task payloads |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Polling frequency in seconds (default: 5) |
| `HEALTH_COLLECT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often the health collector probes the trust services (default: 30) |
| `HEALTH_PROBE_DEGRADED_MS` | A successful probe slower than this reports `degraded` (default: 1000) |
| `XNAT_URL` | Internal URL of XNAT for the health probe (default `http://xnat-web:8080`) |
| `PACS_ID` | XNAT DQR PACS id used for the `ping_pacs` deep probe (default: 1) |
| `OMOP_DB_HOST` / `OMOP_DB_PORT` | OMOP PostgreSQL address for the TCP health probe (defaults `omop-db` / 5432) |
| `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER` | Header name for trust-internal service auth (default `X-Trust-Internal-Service-Key`) |
| `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` | Per-trust plaintext key. Forwarded outbound on every call to imaging-api and data-access-api so those services can authenticate the caller. Minted by `register_trust` (`make register-trust KIT=<CODE>`) into this trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`). |

## Authentication

trust-api authenticates **outbound** in two directions:

- **To the Central Hub**: every request carries `TRUST_API_KEY` in the `TRUST_API_KEY_HEADER`. The hub validates against the `api_key_hash` column on the trust's row in the `trust` table.
- **To sibling trust services** (imaging-api, data-access-api): every request carries `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` in the configured header. Receivers compare with `hmac.compare_digest` against their own copy of the same per-trust key. See the [public security model](../../docs/source/security.rst#trust-internal-service-authentication) for the threat model.

trust-api itself does **not** receive inbound requests from the hub or any external caller — it only polls outbound — so it does not validate an inbound trust-internal header.

## Scaling Assumptions

The trust-api task poller is designed to run as a **single replica per trust**. The central hub's
task-claim endpoint does not use row-level database locking, so running multiple poller replicas
for the same trust would cause duplicate task execution.

If horizontal scaling is needed, the hub endpoint (`GET /tasks/pending`) must be
updated to use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to ensure each task is claimed by exactly
one replica.

## Testing

Tests are split into `tests/` (unit-level, no real backing services — `tests/routers/`, `tests/services/`, etc.) and `tests/integration/` (real OMOP database via the shared `trust/deploy/compose.test.yml` stack). See [Where does my test go?](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#where-does-my-test-go) in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the placement rule, and [`trust/README.md`](../README.md#integration-tests-cohort-query-end-to-end) for how the cohort-query end-to-end suite is wired.

```bash
make local_test         # ruff + mypy + unit suite (no Docker required)
make integration_test   # ruff + mypy + cohort-query end-to-end suite (Docker required)
```
