# CLAUDE.md — trust-api (Trust Gateway)

## Re-read the user prompt (user standing instruction)

YOU MUST READ MY PROMPT AGAIN AND CHECK ALL THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY GET WHAT I WANT IN THE PROMPT.

Before planning, before the first tool call, and again before you finish:
1. Re-read the current user prompt in full. Do not rely on a remembered summary.
2. Check every requirement, constraint, example, exclusion, path, format, and success criterion the prompt actually contains.
3. Confirm the work matches that list with nothing missing, substituted, or silently dropped. If anything is still unclear or blocked, ask once for that blocker only.

## Service Overview

FastAPI gateway running on each trust. Polls the Central Hub for tasks (cohort queries, imaging requests), dispatches to imaging-api or data-access-api, encrypts results with AES_KEY_BASE64, posts back to hub. FL training is orchestrated hub-side by fl-server / fl-api — trust-api does not poll for or handle FL tasks; the trust-side FL participant is fl-client.

## Key Patterns

- Outbound-only communication: trust-api initiates all connections to the Central Hub via `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL`
- Polling loop checks hub for pending tasks at regular intervals
- Encrypts payloads with `AES_KEY_BASE64` before sending to hub
- Communicates with sibling services (imaging-api, data-access-api) on the trust Docker network

## Commands

```bash
make test        # ruff + mypy + pytest (unit only; integration runs via make integration_test)
make unit_test   # Unit tests only (alias for local_test)
make up/down     # Docker compose start/stop
```
