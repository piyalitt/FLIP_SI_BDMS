"""Background polling service: heartbeat → pull pending tasks → dispatch → report.

All communication is outbound from the trust to the hub. The hub identifies the
trust by API key alone — there is no ``{trust_name}`` segment in any URL.

On the first successful heartbeat the hub returns ``{trust_id, trust_name, …}``;
we log the resolved identity (so the operator can see which trust this host
came up as) and, when ``EXPECTED_TRUST_ID`` is set in the kit file, verify the
hub's answer against it. A mismatch means the wrong kit was deployed to the
wrong host — we exit the process so a process-supervisor restart loop surfaces
the misconfiguration loudly rather than the host silently acting as the wrong
trust.
