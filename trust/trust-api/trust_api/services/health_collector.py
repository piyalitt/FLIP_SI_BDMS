"""Background health collector: probes the trust-internal services and caches a snapshot.

The snapshot rides along on the next heartbeat to the hub (see ``task_poller``), which
surfaces it on the Connection Status page. Service keys and statuses form the wire
contract with the hub (``healthy | degraded | down | unknown``):

- ``trust-api`` is never probed — if this loop runs the service is up, so the entry is
  static and the Connection Status page derives the row's status from heartbeat age
  instead.
- ``dicom`` is the PACS connector, probed transitively via imaging-api's ``ping_pacs``
  (imaging-api → XNAT → DIMSE echo). A transport/HTTP failure there proves nothing about
  the PACS itself, so it maps to ``unknown`` rather than ``down``.
- ``omop`` is a raw TCP connect — trust-api deliberately carries no Postgres driver.

Failure semantics: a probe can never raise out of ``collect_once`` (a leaked bug maps to
``unknown``), and a cycle that fails **or hangs** drops the cached snapshot entirely —
the heartbeat then goes bodyless, the hub's freshness stamp stops advancing, and the UI
honestly reports "No data" instead of re-rendering a frozen snapshot as current. The
hang case needs its own deadline because it raises nothing: without one the loop would
never refresh or drop the snapshot, which is the very failure this design prevents.
