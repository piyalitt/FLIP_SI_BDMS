The **imaging-api** is a Trust-side service that manages imaging data operations within the FLIP platform. It
interfaces with [XNAT](https://www.xnat.org/) for imaging project management and [Orthanc](https://www.orthanc-server.com/)
as the mock PACS source. It is called only by the [trust-api](../trust-api/).

Tested with `XNAT version 1.10.0, build: 246` (DQR 3.0.0, Container Service 3.8.1).

## Role in the FLIP Platform

The imaging-api handles the imaging data lifecycle for federated learning studies:

1. **Project creation** — creates XNAT projects and user accounts for approved FL studies
2. **DICOM import** — queries the PACS with accession numbers and queues image retrieval into XNAT, all through XNAT's DQR REST API (XNAT talks to Orthanc over DIMSE; imaging-api itself never contacts Orthanc)
3. **Data download** — packages and transfers XNAT datasets for FL training
4. **Upload** — stores result files back into XNAT experiments
5. **Retrieval status** — monitors import progress by querying the XNAT database

## Deployment

The imaging-api starts as part of the Trust-side stack:

```bash
make up-trusts
```

It requires both [XNAT](../xnat/) and [Orthanc](../orthanc/) to be running.

## API Reference

### Download

Download and unzip a XNAT dataset to a local folder.

```json
{
  "encrypted_central_hub_project_id": "string",
  "accession_id": "string"
}
```

### Imaging

Interfaces with XNAT's DICOM Query-Retrieve (DQR) plugin. Full DQR API docs available at
`http://127.0.0.1:8104/xapi/swagger-ui.html#/dicom-query-retrieve-api`.

- Query PACS with an accession number
- Queue image retrieval from PACS to an XNAT project

Example DQR import request:

```json
{
  "pacsId": 1,
  "aeTitle": "XNAT",
  "port": 8104,
  "projectId": "b83294b0-4ff8-4629-bfb3-4cb587e87756",
  "forceImport": true,
  "studies": [{
    "studyInstanceUid": "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.274.1.1.8323329.1190647.1740750893.798613",
    "accessionNumber": "FAK77115197"
  }]
}
```

### Projects

Create an XNAT project from a Central Hub project:

```json
{
  "project_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "trust_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "project_name": "my_project",
  "query": "some query",
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
      "email": "user@company.com",
      "is_disabled": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Retrieval

Get import status or count for a project (queries the XNAT PostgreSQL database directly):

```
project_id: 8ba38209-97f5-41b9-976e-dfe3c5c8dd94
query: SELECT * FROM omop.image_occurrence
```

### Upload

Upload files to an XNAT experiment:

```json
{
  "encrypted_central_hub_project_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "accession_id": "FAK09131796",
  "scan_id": "12345",
  "resource_id": "RES",
  "files": [
    "FAK09131796/scans/1_2_826_.../resources/NIFTI/files/input.nii"
  ],
  "exist_ok": true
}
```

### Users

Create users, update user details, or add a user to an XNAT project.

## Configuration

Key environment variables (set in [`.env.development.example`](../../.env.development.example)):

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `XNAT_URL` | URL of the XNAT instance |
| `XNAT_SERVICE_USER` | XNAT service account username |
| `XNAT_SERVICE_PASSWORD` | XNAT service account password |
| `XNAT_DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string for the XNAT database (non-secret topology constant; defaults in `config.py`, and the default carries **no** password) |
| `XNAT_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` | Minted per-trust XNAT DB password from the kit file (FLIP-PT-056). When set, it replaces the password embedded in `XNAT_DATABASE_URL`; empty or the kit-template placeholder leaves the URL untouched, so a pre-mint deployment fails on its first query instead of falling back to a weak credential |
| `DATA_ACCESS_API_URL` | Internal URL of the data-access-api |
| `AES_KEY_BASE64` | AES encryption key for decrypting project identifiers |
| `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER` | Header name for trust-internal service auth (default `X-Trust-Internal-Service-Key`) |
| `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` | Per-trust plaintext key. Validated as inbound auth on every router except `/health`, and forwarded outbound on calls to data-access-api `/cohort/accession-ids`. |

### Troubleshooting: healthy service, but every XNAT-DB query returns 500

Unlike xnat-web and xnat-db — whose entrypoints refuse to boot on a missing or weak credential —
imaging-api starts normally when `XNAT_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` is unset or still the kit-template
placeholder. The engine is created lazily and `/health` reports `{"status": "ok"}` without touching
the database, so a mis-minted kit looks healthy until the first XNAT-DB query. It then surfaces as a
bare **500** with `asyncpg.exceptions.InvalidPasswordError` (or `no password supplied`) in the logs —
typically on `GET /retrieval/import_status_count/{project_id}`, i.e. the project appears stuck at the
imaging-import step.

The tell is imaging-api's own start-up line, which logs the DSN with the password masked:

```
Database URL: postgresql+asyncpg://xnat@xnat-db:5432/xnat      # no password — kit not minted
Database URL: postgresql+asyncpg://xnat:***@xnat-db:5432/xnat  # password spliced in
```

Remedy: mint the credential into the trust's kit file with `make generate-xnat-credentials`
(`KIT=<CODE>` for one trust) and redeploy. If xnat-db's data volume was already initialised with a
different password, Postgres will not pick the new one up — apply the `ALTER ROLE` that
`make generate-xnat-credentials FORCE=1` prints. See [XNAT setup](../xnat/README.md).

## Authentication

imaging-api exposes privileged XNAT operations via a service account. To prevent any container on the trust Docker network — or any operator with SSM port-forward access — from acting as that service account, every router except `/health` requires callers to send `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` in the configured header. imaging-api compares the header against its own copy of the same per-trust key with a constant-time compare.

Direct callers in this repo: trust-api. The fl-client container calls imaging-api indirectly via
the [`flip` Python package](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/tree/develop/flip-utils/flip)
(consumed by both NVFLARE and Flower fl-client / fl-server images) —
`flip.get_by_accession_number(...)` and friends read `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` from
`os.environ` and add the header to every HTTP request. User training code (`client_app.py`,
`server_app.py`, tutorials) doesn't see the header.

imaging-api is also a *sender*: it forwards the same key on every call to data-access-api `/cohort/accession-ids`, which now has the same auth check on its `/cohort` router.

Each trust has a distinct key. A trust's `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` is minted by `register_trust` (`make register-trusts`) and written into that trust's kit file (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`), which `trust/Makefile` `-include`s so every trust-internal container inherits it.

[Trust-internal service authentication](../../docs/source/security.rst#trust-internal-service-authentication).
