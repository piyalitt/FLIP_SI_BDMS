# AGENTS.md — data-access-api (OMOP Queries)

## Re-read the user prompt (user standing instruction)

YOU MUST READ MY PROMPT AGAIN AND CHECK ALL THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY GET WHAT I WANT IN THE PROMPT.

Before planning, before the first tool call, and again before you finish:
1. Re-read the current user prompt in full. Do not rely on a remembered summary.
2. Check every requirement, constraint, example, exclusion, path, format, and success criterion the prompt actually contains.
3. Confirm the work matches that list with nothing missing, substituted, or silently dropped. If anything is still unclear or blocked, ask once for that blocker only.

## Service Overview

FastAPI service for querying the OMOP Common Data Model database. Receives cohort query requests from trust-api, translates them to SQL, executes against omop-db, and returns results.

## Key Patterns

- Connects to omop-db (PostgreSQL port 5432) on the trust network
- Receives internal requests from trust-api (all `/cohort` endpoints) and from imaging-api (`/cohort/accession-ids`); not directly exposed
- Every internal caller authenticates with the per-trust `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` header (see the root `AGENTS.md` "Trust-internal Service Authentication" section). `/health` stays unauthenticated
- OMOP CDM query translation layer
- `services/cohort.py::validate_query` is the **authority** on cohort-query safety: one parse-validate-emit pass that returns the query re-emitted from the AST it checked. Pass that return value to the engine, never the caller's raw string. The hub runs its own pre-check, but it is fast-feedback only and deliberately weaker — never relax a rule here on the assumption the hub filtered first, and do not mirror trust-local rules onto the hub. See [`README.md`](README.md#cohort-query-validation)
- Both row-level routes — `/cohort/dataframe` (FL training data) and `/cohort/accession-ids` (the accession list that decides whose imaging is pulled into XNAT) — are gated on `COHORT_QUERY_THRESHOLD` and share one fixed refusal string, so a below-threshold cohort is indistinguishable from an empty one and the refusal cannot act as a row-count oracle. The trust enforces this itself; the hub's staging guard is not relied on
- The gates evaluate the **live** cohort on every call, not the cohort as approved. The cohort query is re-run against OMOP at every stage (the imaging status poll alone re-runs it roughly every 10s while a project page is open), so a project can import cleanly and later start refusing. There is no frozen approved-cohort artefact anywhere in FLIP — see FLIP#857
- `COHORT_QUERY_THRESHOLD` is the trust's own disclosure floor (default 10), set per trust in its kit file. It is a `PositiveInt`: `0` would disable both row-level gates (`len(df) < 0` is never true) *and* the statistics suppression at once, so a non-positive value is rejected at import and the service refuses to start rather than run with no floor. Its default lives in one place — the module-level `DEFAULT_COHORT_QUERY_THRESHOLD`, read by both the field default and the empty-string coercion validator; do not re-inline the literal. Requiring the value to be at least the shipped 10 rather than merely positive is FLIP#870. Any new non-`str` setting needs its own empty-string coercion validator: the service Makefile's `export $(shell sed 's/=.*//' $(KIT_ENV_FILE))` strips values from commented lines too, so a commented-out entry arrives as `""` and pydantic rejects it at import
