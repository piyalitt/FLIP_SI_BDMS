# no name and no schema on its exp.Table node, so the schema pin cannot reach it — and Postgres
# resolves it through the implicit pg_catalog, the same route the pin exists to close. There is no
# schema to pin it to (these live in pg_catalog, not omop), so the only available control is an
# allowlist. Keep it an allowlist, never a denylist of dangerous names: ``query_to_xml`` executes a
# SQL string that sqlglot never parses, so it bypasses every other rule in validate_query, and the
# next such function is one Postgres release away.
_ALLOWED_TABLE_FUNCTIONS = frozenset({"generate_series", "unnest"})

# Functions permitted anywhere an expression is — select list, WHERE, a LATERAL FROM item, a
# subquery. A dangerous function is not confined to the FROM clause: the schema pin and the
# FROM-clause allowlist above both key on exp.Table nodes, so ``FROM LATERAL query_to_xml(...)``
# (an exp.Lateral, not an exp.Table), ``SELECT pg_read_file(...)`` and ``WHERE pg_ls_dir(...) IS
# NOT NULL`` all slipped past while Postgres still resolved them through the implicit pg_catalog.
# sqlglot models the ordinary cohort functions (COUNT, SUM, DATE_PART, COALESCE, SUBSTRING, ...) as
# typed nodes and wraps everything it does not recognise in exp.Anonymous — and the dangerous
# pg_catalog functions all land there: the query_to_xml family executes an unparsed SQL string,
# pg_read_file / pg_ls_dir / pg_stat_file read the server filesystem, current_setting / dblink /
# lo_import reach further still. So an unrecognised (Anonymous) function is rejected wherever it
# appears unless it is on this allowlist. This stays an allowlist for the same reason the table one
# does; the table functions are a subset (they are also legitimate in a lateral or scalar
# position), and ``age`` is included because deriving patient age is an ordinary cohort filter and
# sqlglot happens to leave it Anonymous. Every real cohort query in the tutorials uses only typed

    Validates that an inbound SQL query is structurally safe to run against OMOP.

    Database-layer protections already in place
    -------------------------------------------
    The data-access-api connects as ``data_analyst_reader`` (see
    ``trust/omop-db/files/create_readonly_users.sql``), a Postgres role with no write
    privileges: ``INSERT`` / ``UPDATE`` / ``DELETE`` / ``TRUNCATE`` / ``CREATE`` are
    never granted, and are explicitly REVOKEd on top. Any DDL or DML is therefore
    rejected by Postgres itself, so this function does NOT keyword-filter for ``DROP``
    / ``INSERT`` / ``UPDATE`` / etc. Rules 3 and 4 below still reject writes
    *structurally*, from the parsed tree rather than from a keyword scan, so a write
    fails in-hand with a clear 400 instead of as an opaque permission error from the
    engine.

    **Read scope is NOT guaranteed by the database role, and differs by deployment.**
    The Kubernetes trust chart grants the role ``pg_read_all_data``
    (``deploy/providers/kubernetes/templates/omop-db.yaml``) — SELECT on every table
    in every schema — while the Compose path grants only ``USAGE`` on ``omop`` plus
    ``SELECT`` on its tables. So rule 5 below is the *only* thing keeping a caller
    inside ``omop`` on a Kubernetes trust, not a redundant second layer over a narrow
    grant. Do not weaken it on the assumption the role is scoped. Narrowing that grant
    to match Compose is tracked separately in FLIP#904; until it lands, this is the barrier.

    What this function enforces
    ---------------------------
    Since the read-only role can still issue arbitrary ``SELECT`` queries:

    1. The query is shorter than ``MAX_QUERY_LENGTH`` (DoS guard).
    2. The query parses as exactly one non-empty statement (defeats query stacking,
       stray semicolons that bypass the count check, and empty inputs).
    3. The top-level statement is SELECT-shaped (rejects ``COPY``, ``EXPLAIN``,
       and top-level DDL/DML — fail fast at the API rather than at the DB).
    4. No ``INSERT`` / ``UPDATE`` / ``DELETE`` / ``MERGE`` node appears *anywhere*
       in the tree. Rule 3 inspects only the top-level node, and Postgres allows a
       writable CTE — ``WITH x AS (DELETE FROM t RETURNING *) SELECT * FROM x``
       parses as a ``Select`` and would otherwise pass. The read-only role rejects
       the write regardless, so this is defence in depth, not the only barrier.
    5. Every table reference is pinned to the ``omop`` schema. A qualified
       reference to any other schema is rejected, as is a three-part
       ``db.schema.table`` reference; an *unqualified* reference is rewritten to
       ``omop.<table>`` in the AST before emission. Rewriting rather than
       trusting ``search_path`` is the load-bearing part: Postgres searches
       ``pg_catalog`` implicitly and first, whatever ``search_path`` says, so an
       unqualified ``pg_class`` would otherwise read the catalog — and on a
       Kubernetes trust the role can read every schema (see above). Names bound
       by a ``WITH`` clause are exempt because they are not schema-qualified and
       never can be. The exemption is determined from each lexical SQL scope, so
       a CTE in a nested query cannot exempt a table reference in its parent, and
       from Postgres-folded identifiers rather than raw text, so a quoted CTE
       name cannot exempt a reference that would not bind to it, and a quoted
       ``"OMOP"`` — a schema Postgres holds distinct from ``omop`` — is not
       read as the allowed one.

       A set-returning function in the ``FROM`` clause is checked against an
       allowlist instead. It carries no name and no schema to pin, and it
       resolves in ``pg_catalog`` rather than ``omop``, so pinning cannot
       express anything about it. The same allowlist is applied to every
       *unrecognised* function wherever it appears — a ``LATERAL`` function
       item, the select list, a ``WHERE`` predicate — since those positions
       reach ``pg_catalog`` too and are not ``exp.Table`` nodes for the pin to
       act on. ``query_to_xml`` and friends are the reason: they execute an
       unparsed SQL string and so bypass every other rule here.
    6. Every ``LIMIT`` and ``OFFSET`` is a literal integer (defeats the blind
       data-extraction technique that abuses
       ``LIMIT CASE WHEN <predicate> THEN n ELSE m END`` to make the row count
       a function of a single character value, then reads it back via the
       cohort-size error message).

    This function is the **authority** on cohort-query safety. The central hub
    runs its own pre-check before fanning a query out
    (``flip_api.cohort_services.submit_cohort_query.validate_query``), but that
    one exists purely for fast feedback and is deliberately weaker: the hub is a
    separate administrative domain, so nothing here may be relaxed on the
    assumption that the hub filtered first.

    Returns:
