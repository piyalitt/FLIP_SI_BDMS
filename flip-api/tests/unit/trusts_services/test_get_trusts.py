"""Unit tests for the authenticated trust-list endpoint (GET /trust).

This single list-of-trusts endpoint powers both the trust pickers and the
Connection Status page. It is deliberately NOT admin-gated: every authenticated
role (Researcher, Viewer, Admin) may read it. The fields it returns are benign
trust metadata — no secrets. Creating a trust (POST /admin/trusts) remains
admin-only.
