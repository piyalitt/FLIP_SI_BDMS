"""Integration coverage of the trust heartbeat against real Postgres.

A trust registered with an arbitrary display name (spaces + parentheses)
authenticates by its API key alone. ``POST /api/trust/heartbeat`` returns the
resolved ``{trust_id, trust_name}`` (so the trust-api can self-check) and
stamps the ``last_heartbeat`` column. Exercises the full chain — DB row →
``authenticate_trust`` → handler — through a real session, which mocked unit
tests cannot.
