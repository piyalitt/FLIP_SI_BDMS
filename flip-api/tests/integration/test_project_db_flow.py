"""Integration coverage of the project_services DB path: create → fetch → soft-delete → approve.

Hits ``project_services.services.project_services`` against the throwaway
Postgres rather than mocking the session. Unit tests for the same code mock
``Session`` and never catch SQL-shaped bugs (wrong column names, missing
relationships, default mismatches, etc.); these do.
