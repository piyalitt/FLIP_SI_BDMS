    Retrieve all available job types and their required files.

    This endpoint returns a dictionary mapping each job type name to its
    list of required files. This allows the UI to dynamically determine
    which files are required for training based on the config.json job_type.
    The required files are read from the manifest of whichever FL backend the
    nets currently report.

    Returns:
        dict[str, list[str]]: A dictionary where keys are job type names
            (e.g., 'standard', 'evaluation') and values are lists of required
            file names (e.g., ['trainer.py', 'config.json', 'models.py']).

    Example Response:

        .. code-block:: json

            {
                "standard": ["trainer.py", "config.json", "models.py"],
                "evaluation": ["evaluator.py", "config.json", "models.py"],
                "fed_opt": ["trainer.py", "config.json", "models.py"],
                "diffusion_model": ["trainer.py", "validator.py", "config.json", "models.py"]
