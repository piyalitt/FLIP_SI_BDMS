"""Generate the XNAT Postgres + ActiveMQ credentials in an environment file.

The XNAT trust services (xnat-web + xnat-db) require three passwords:

* ``XNAT_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`` — XNAT app's connection password to xnat-db.
* ``XNAT_DATASOURCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`` — Postgres superuser password on xnat-db.
* ``XNAT_ACTIVEMQ_PASSWORD`` — ActiveMQ broker password used by XNAT for async work.

These were previously committed to the repo with weak defaults and baked into
the published Docker image at build time. They are now per-trust secrets: minted
into the trust's kit file (``trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>``) at registration time and
loaded into the containers as runtime environment variables only. The kit file is
the target because trust hosts carry no hub env file — ``trust/xnat/Makefile``
exports the kit's values for ``docker stack deploy`` substitution.

Usage (root Makefile wraps this per kit; runs automatically in register-trust):
    make generate-xnat-credentials                 # every local kit file
    make generate-xnat-credentials KIT=GSTT        # one kit
    make generate-xnat-credentials FORCE=1         # rotate existing values

Rotation caveat: Postgres applies ``XNAT_DATASOURCE_*`` only on the very first
initdb of the xnat-db data volume. Rotating after that volume exists changes what
xnat-web sends but not what Postgres expects, so the stack fails auth on the next
deploy (the entrypoint fails fast with a credential-mismatch error). Update the
live database to match the kit (``ALTER ROLE``) — the script prints the exact
commands whenever it overwrites a previously-real value.
