    Collect the IDs of every permission granted to a user through their roles.

    Raises rather than swallowing DB errors: each caller converts a failure into a deny, so the
    fail-closed behaviour stays visible at the point where the access decision is made.

    Args:
        user_id (UUID): The ID of the user to collect permissions for.
        db (Session): The database session to query user roles and permissions.

    Returns:
        set[UUID]: The permission IDs granted by the user's roles.

def has_permissions(user_id: UUID, required_permissions: list[PermissionRef], db: Session) -> bool:

    Check if a user has ALL of the required permissions.

    This is an AND check — ``has_permissions(uid, [A, B], db)`` is True only when the user holds
    both A and B. For an OR check, use :func:`has_any_permission`; passing two permissions here
    when either would do silently denies everyone who holds just one of them.

    An empty list grants nothing (returns False), matching :func:`has_any_permission`, so a caller
    cannot accidentally allow everyone by passing no permissions. That guard is explicit here
    because the natural implementation fails *open*: ``all()`` over an empty sequence is True, and
    the ``except`` below would not catch it — with nothing to check, the query succeeds and the
    generator never runs.

    Args:
        user_id (UUID): The ID of the user to check permissions for.
        required_permissions (list[PermissionRef]): A list of permissions to check against the user's roles.
        db (Session): The database session to query user roles and permissions.
