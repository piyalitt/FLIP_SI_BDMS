    """Emit one typed activity row per queued job whose queue position changed.

    The FL queue is ``FLJob`` rows in ``QUEUED`` status, ordered by ``created``
    ascending — exactly the order ``check_for_queued_jobs`` picks from, so
    position 1 is the next model to start when a net frees up. For each queued
    job the last logged ``QUEUE_POSITION`` row is compared (keyed by job id, so
    a re-initiated model always re-logs its first position); a row is written
    only when the position is new or changed, making the function idempotent —
    callers invoke it after any queue mutation without worrying about noise.
    Rows are batched into a single commit so a deep queue never costs O(N)
    commits per mutation.

    Idempotence holds for serialized callers only: emit-on-change is a
    read-then-write with nothing locked, so concurrent calls (the scheduler
    tick on its ``BackgroundScheduler`` thread vs a request thread, or a
    second flip-api replica) can both read the same prior rows and both
    write, leaving duplicate — or transiently contradictory — feed rows.
    That is tolerated: positions are a display nicety and the next mutation
    self-heals. The hub currently runs one flip-api replica with a single
    Uvicorn worker (ECS ``desired_count = 1``, no autoscaling; ``fastapi
    run`` without ``--workers``), so only in-process thread interleaving can
    race. Scaling flip-api out multiplies the emission sites per tick — close
    the race then with ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` on the queued jobs or a
    partial unique index over the ``details`` (job_id, position) pair.

    Positions are a display nicety: any failure is logged, the batch is rolled
    back, and nothing is raised — an emission problem can never wedge the
    scheduler tick or the caller's queue mutation. **Precondition:** call this
    only after the caller has committed its own mutation; the failure-path
    rollback would otherwise discard the caller's uncommitted state.
