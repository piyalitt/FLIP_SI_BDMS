    Initiate training for a model by adding it to the queue.

    This endpoint allows a user to initiate training for a specified model by adding it to the training queue.
    It checks if the user has access to the model and updates the model status accordingly.

    Args:
        model_id (UUID): The ID of the model to initiate training for.
        payload (IInitiateTrainingInputPayload): The payload containing the ids of the trusts to train on.
        request (Request): The FastAPI request object.
        db (Session): Database session.
        user_id (UUID): User ID from authentication.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        HTTPException: If the user is not allowed, if the model does not exist, or if there is an
                        error during the initiation process.
