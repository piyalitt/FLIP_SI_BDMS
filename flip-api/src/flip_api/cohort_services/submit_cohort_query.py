    Fast-feedback validity pre-check for a cohort query. **Not a security control.**

    Why this exists at all
    ----------------------
    The trust-side ``data-access-api`` is the *authority* on what a cohort query
    may do (see ``data_access_api.services.cohort.validate_query``), and it is
    deliberately self-sufficient: a trust holds patient data and must stay safe
    regardless of what the hub did or did not check, because the hub is a
    separate administrative domain that the trust does not trust. Anything this
    function enforced for safety would therefore have to be enforced trust-side
    anyway, so duplicating the trust's rules here would buy no security — only
    two copies of one policy to keep in sync.

    What it buys instead is **fast feedback**. Submitting a cohort query fans it
    out to every registered trust as an encrypted task, each of which runs its
    own validation asynchronously and reports back. Without a pre-check, a
    researcher who typos their SQL waits for that whole round-trip, across N
    trusts, to be told. Catching "this cannot possibly succeed anywhere" while
    the request is still in-hand turns a multi-minute fan-out into a 400.

    The asymmetry is intentional and safe by construction
    -----------------------------------------------------
    This check is deliberately *weaker* than the trust's, and only ever rejects
    queries that every trust would reject too. It intentionally does **not**
    enforce trust-local policy — the ``omop`` schema pin, literal-``LIMIT``
    rule, read-only role, or minimum-cohort threshold — because those depend on
    facts the hub has no authority over and which may legitimately differ per
    trust.

    That makes drift between the two harmless in the direction that matters: a
    hub lagging behind the trust merely wastes a fan-out on a query the trust
    then refuses, never a bypass. Do not "fix" the asymmetry by copying the
    trust's rules in here.
