) -> tuple[list[UUID], list[UUID], list[UUID]]:
    """Split QueryResult rows into ``(responded, errored, empty)`` trust IDs in one pass.

    Each distinct trust's ``data`` blob is parsed once and classified, rather than walked
    separately per category. All three lists preserve row order and dedup a trust by its
    first occurrence; ``errored`` and ``empty`` are disjoint subsets of ``responded``.

    - **responded**: every distinct non-null trust ID that posted a row (success or error).
      A trust must be here — and not errored or empty — to be stage-eligible; the set is
      also surfaced to the per-trust UI.
    - **errored**: responded trusts whose ``data`` carries a non-null ``error``, or that fail
      to parse (malformed JSON, or a ``record_count`` that won't coerce to an int). Better to
      mark the trust red than silently swallow a corrupt response and let staging include
      results we never validated.
    - **empty**: responded, non-errored trusts with ``record_count == 0`` — a genuine zero
      match or a privacy-suppressed below-threshold count. The trust reports both as
      ``record_count=0`` and flags both ``suppressed`` (they are deliberately
      indistinguishable, see issue #519), so neither has a usable cohort and both must be
      excluded from staging.
