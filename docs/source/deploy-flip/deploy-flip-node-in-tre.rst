Overview
========

FLIP supports two deployment modes for trust-side services:

- **On-premise**: The FLIP node runs directly on Trust infrastructure (e.g. NVIDIA DGX)
  with live access to the Trust's OMOP database and PACS. This is the primary deployment
  model and provides full access to the Trust's electronic health records for cohort
  discovery and imaging data.

- **Trusted Research Environment (TRE)**: The FLIP node runs inside a TRE that has been
  pre-populated with a project-specific subset of data. This mode supports Trusts where
  governance or infrastructure constraints require data access through a TRE rather than
  direct on-premise compute.

This guide covers the TRE deployment mode. For on-premise deployment, see
:doc:`deploy-flip-node-on-prem`.

.. note::

   TRE deployment is an alternative to on-premise deployment, not a replacement. The
   on-premise model remains the recommended approach where Trust infrastructure and
   governance permit it.

TRE Operator Responsibilities
=============================

Deploying FLIP inside a TRE involves coordination between the FLIP team and the TRE
operator. The TRE operator is responsible for:

**Data provisioning (one-off, per project)**

- Ingesting the anonymised OMOP dataset and DICOM imaging data into the TRE via the TRE's
  standard SOP (after DAC approval).
- Provisioning an OMOP PostgreSQL database and a PACS instance (e.g. Orthanc) inside the
  TRE, with consistent pseudonymisation so records can be linked across them.

**Compute provisioning**

- Providing a host with Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and Docker Swarm support, plus at
  least one NVIDIA GPU accessible via the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
- Creating the writable host paths the FLIP stack expects under ``/opt/flip/`` (for certs,
  FL data, OMOP DB volumes, and observability storage -- see the Ansible playbook at
  ``deploy/providers/local/site_local_trust.yml``).

**Container image ingestion**

FLIP container images are published to the GitHub Container Registry
(``ghcr.io/londonaicentre/*``). Because TREs typically block direct pulls from public
registries, images must be ingested through the TRE's normal file-ingress process. A
common pattern:

1. Outside the TRE, pull and save each image to a tarball on a workstation that has
   internet access:

   .. code-block:: shell

      docker pull ghcr.io/londonaicentre/trust-api:<tag>
      docker save ghcr.io/londonaicentre/trust-api:<tag> -o trust-api-<tag>.tar

2. Submit the tarballs through the TRE's file-ingress airlock.
3. Inside the TRE, load each image into the local Docker daemon:

   .. code-block:: shell

      docker load -i trust-api-<tag>.tar

.. note::

   Other image distribution approaches may be acceptable depending on the TRE --
   for example, a TRE-internal Docker registry (e.g. Harbor, GitLab, or a registry
   mirror) that is pre-populated with the required images and reachable from the
   FLIP host. Coordinate with the TRE operator to pick the option that best fits
   local policy.

**Network policy**

- Allow outbound HTTPS (port 443) from the FLIP host to the Central Hub FLIP API endpoint —
  the ALB (e.g. ``https://app.flip.aicentre.co.uk``).
- Allow outbound gRPC or HTTP to the FL Server endpoint — a **separate** host fronted by its
  own load balancer (the NLB), on its configurable port (e.g. ``fl.app.flip.aicentre.co.uk:8002``).
  Allowlisting the API host alone is not sufficient.
- No inbound ports need to be opened on the TRE perimeter.

**Output review**

- Operating the TRE's standard output-checking (airlock) process for aggregate metrics
  leaving the TRE during federated evaluation.
- Agreeing a project-specific governance process for federated training if weight egress
  is in scope (see :ref:`tre-deployment` Use Case 2).

Architecture
============

In the on-premise model, the FLIP node has direct access to the Trust's full OMOP database
and can pull imaging data live from PACS. In the TRE model, the FLIP node operates on a
pre-populated subset of data inside the TRE boundary.

Two communication pathways connect the FLIP node to the Central Hub (hosted on AWS):

1. **Central Hub FLIP API <-> Trust API**: Cohort queries, project creation, imaging project
   management, and status updates.

2. **FL Server <-> FL Client**: Model distribution (for evaluation) and model weight exchange
   (for federated training), orchestrated via the FL framework (e.g. NVIDIA FLARE, Flower).

Both pathways use **outbound-only** connections, making FLIP compatible with TRE network
policies that block inbound traffic.

   FLIP TRE deployment: outbound-only connections from the FLIP node to the Central Hub.

Communication: Outbound-Only Design
------------------------------------

TREs are "walled garden" environments that block inbound network connections. All
communication from the FLIP node is initiated from inside the TRE outward to the
Central Hub. No inbound ports need to be opened on the TRE side.

**FL Server <-> FL Client**

The FL channel uses a client-pull model. The FL client initiates all communication --
it connects outbound to the FL server, polls for tasks, executes locally, and pushes
results back. The FL server never initiates inbound connections to client sites:

- In NVIDIA FLARE, the FL client sends ``GET_TASK`` requests to the FL server and receives
  tasks in the response, then returns results via ``SUBMIT_RESULT``.

- In Flower, each SuperNode acts as a gRPC client connecting outbound to the SuperLink.
  SuperNodes initiate all requests and do not accept incoming connections.

The TRE need only whitelist outbound gRPC (or HTTP, if using an HTTP/REST transport
fallback) to the FL server endpoint.

**Central Hub FLIP API <-> Trust API**

The Trust API uses an outbound polling model to communicate with the Central Hub. Rather
than the Central Hub pushing requests inbound, the Trust API periodically polls the
Central Hub for new instructions:

- The Trust API calls the Central Hub FLIP API to check for new projects, cohort query
  requests, and status updates.

- When a new project is created on the Central Hub, the Trust API discovers it on its next
  poll cycle and initiates the local workflow (cohort query against OMOP, imaging pull from
  PACS into XNAT).

- Results (cohort statistics, project status) are pushed outbound from the Trust API to the
  Central Hub.

The polling loop is implemented in ``trust/trust-api/trust_api/services/task_poller.py``.
Key environment variables (set via ``.env`` or Docker secrets):

   * - Variable
     - Description
   * - ``CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL``
     - Hub endpoint the Trust API polls for tasks.
   * - ``EXPECTED_TRUST_ID``
     - Optional self-check. If set and the hub resolves this host's API key to a
       different trust *id*, trust-api exits instead of acting as the wrong
       trust. Kept in the trust's kit file.
   * - ``TRUST_API_KEY`` / ``TRUST_API_KEY_HEADER``
     - Per-trust authentication header used on every outbound request.
   * - ``AES_KEY_BASE64``
     - Symmetric key shared with the hub; used to decrypt task payloads.
   * - ``TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY``
     - Per-trust shared secret used inside the trust for calls between
       trust-api / imaging-api / fl-client and imaging-api /
       data-access-api. Never leaves the trust environment.
   * - ``POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS``
     - Polling period in seconds (default: ``5``).

.. admonition:: Network requirements

   The TRE must whitelist outbound connections to **two separate endpoints** — different
   hostnames behind different load balancers, so both must be allowlisted:

   - The Central Hub FLIP API — the ALB (HTTPS, port 443; e.g. ``https://app.flip.aicentre.co.uk``)
   - The FL Server — the NLB (gRPC or HTTP, configurable port; e.g. ``fl.app.flip.aicentre.co.uk:8002``)

   No inbound ports need to be opened on the TRE.

Data Flow
=========

The key difference between on-premise and TRE deployment is how data enters the FLIP node.

On-Premise Data Flow
---------------------

1. FLIP user submits a cohort query on the Central Hub.
2. The query is federated to all FLIP nodes.
3. The Trust API queries the full OMOP database and returns aggregated cohort statistics.
4. Once the project is approved by the Data Access Committee (DAC), the imaging API pulls
   DICOMs from the Trust's production PACS into a DICOM staging server (e.g. Orthanc).
5. XNAT pulls from the staging server into a dedicated project, where images can be
   enriched.
6. FL training or evaluation jobs run on the local data.

TRE Data Flow
--------------

The TRE model splits the workflow into two phases:

**Phase 1: Pre-FLIP (TRE data ingestion)**

Before the FLIP user interacts with the system, the Trust's data team:

1. Estimates the cohort size against the full Trust EHR (outside FLIP).
2. Submits and receives DAC approval for the project.
3. Exports anonymised OMOP records and DICOM imaging data through the TRE's standard
   operating procedure (SOP), including anonymisation and defacing where required (e.g.
   brain CT scans).
4. Loads the anonymised data into:

   - An **OMOP database** inside the TRE.
   - A **PACS instance** (e.g. Orthanc) inside the TRE.

.. note::

   The OMOP database and PACS inside the TRE must use consistent pseudonymisation so that
   clinical records and imaging data can be linked within the TRE.

**Phase 2: FLIP workflow (inside the TRE)**

Once data is loaded, the FLIP workflow proceeds largely as normal:

1. When a FLIP project is created on the Central Hub, the Trust API inside the TRE
   discovers it (via outbound polling) and triggers the local workflow.
2. The FLIP user runs a cohort query. The ``data-access-api`` queries the OMOP database
   inside the TRE. This selects from the pre-loaded project subset, not the full Trust
   population.
3. Once the cohort is selected, XNAT pulls DICOMs from the TRE's internal PACS -- using the
   same C-MOVE/C-GET pattern it would use against a production PACS.
4. The FLIP user submits FL training or evaluation jobs.

.. important::

   In the TRE model, cohort queries operate on a **pre-scoped dataset**. The FLIP user can
   refine and select within the approved data, but cannot discover patients beyond what was
   loaded into the TRE. Cohort size estimation across the full Trust population must happen
   before the DAC application, outside FLIP.

Prerequisites
=============

The TRE must provide the following capabilities:

Compute
--------

- **Docker with GPU support**: The FLIP Docker stack requires the
  `NVIDIA Container Toolkit <https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html>`_
  for GPU-accelerated FL training and inference.

- **Docker Swarm**: XNAT services are deployed using Docker Swarm mode. The TRE must
  support ``docker swarm init`` and overlay networking.

- **Sufficient GPU resources**: At minimum, one NVIDIA GPU for inference/evaluation. For FL
  training, GPU memory requirements depend on the model architecture.

Networking
-----------

- **Outbound HTTPS** to the Central Hub FLIP API endpoint on AWS
  (e.g. ``https://app.flip.aicentre.co.uk``).

- **Outbound gRPC or HTTP** to the FL Server endpoint — a separate host fronted by the NLB
  (e.g. ``fl.app.flip.aicentre.co.uk:8002``).
  If the TRE's network inspection
  appliances block HTTP/2 (required for gRPC), most FL frameworks offer HTTP/REST transport
  fallbacks (e.g. NVIDIA FLARE's HTTP driver, Flower's REST transport) that work over
  standard HTTP/1.1.

- **No inbound connections required.**

Data
-----

- An **OMOP database** (PostgreSQL) pre-populated with the project's anonymised clinical
  data.

- A **PACS instance** (e.g. Orthanc) pre-populated with the project's anonymised DICOM
  imaging data.

- Consistent pseudonymisation between OMOP records and DICOM data so they can be linked
  within the TRE.

Software
---------

- Docker Engine (>= 24.0) with Docker Compose (>= 2.40)
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- Python 3.12 or 3.13
- PostgreSQL client libraries (``postgresql-client``)
- Make

Observability
-------------

FLIP deploys a log-aggregation stack (Grafana Alloy, Loki, Grafana) alongside the Trust
APIs. Alloy scrapes container stdout via the Docker socket, Loki stores logs with 30-day
retention, and Grafana provides a pre-provisioned dashboard. The stack runs entirely
inside the TRE boundary -- no log data is sent to the Central Hub. See :doc:`/components/component-logging-stack`
for details on configuration, ports, and persistent volumes.

Use Case 1: Federated Evaluation
==================================

Federated evaluation is the most TRE-compatible FLIP workflow. A pretrained model is
distributed from the Central Hub to FLIP nodes for local evaluation, and only **aggregate
metrics** (AUC, Dice scores, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrices) are returned.

Why evaluation is TRE-friendly
-------------------------------

- **Model ingress**: The pretrained model file is sent from the FL server to the FL client
  inside the TRE. TREs routinely handle data ingress.

- **Metrics-only egress**: Only aggregate evaluation metrics leave the TRE -- not model
  weights. These metrics are standard summary statistics that TRE output-checking processes
  (airlocks) are designed to review.

- **Single egress event**: Unlike training, which requires iterative weight exchange across
  many rounds, evaluation produces a single set of results that can go through standard TRE
  output review.

- **No disclosure risk from model weights**: Since no locally-trained model weights are
  exported, there is no risk of patient data leakage through model memorisation or
  gradient-based reconstruction attacks.

Evaluation data flow
---------------------

1. A pretrained model is uploaded to the Central Hub.
2. The FL server distributes the model to FL clients at each FLIP node (including TRE
   nodes) via the FL framework's evaluation workflow.
3. Each FL client runs inference on local data and computes evaluation metrics.
4. Only the aggregate metrics are sent back to the FL server.

.. note::

   For TRE nodes, the aggregate metrics leaving the TRE should comply with the TRE's
   output-checking policy. Ensure that subgroup analyses on small populations (fewer than
   the TRE's minimum cell count, typically 5-10) are suppressed before egress.

Use Case 2: Federated Training
================================

Federated training in a TRE involves iterative exchange of model weights between the FL
client (inside the TRE) and the FL server (on the Central Hub). This is more complex from
a governance perspective than evaluation.

Training data flow
-------------------

1. The FL server sends the initial global model to all FL clients.
2. Each FL client trains locally for a number of local rounds.
3. The FL client sends updated model weights back to the FL server.
4. The FL server aggregates weights from all clients (e.g. via FedAvg) and distributes the
   updated global model.
5. Steps 2-4 repeat for the configured number of global rounds until convergence.

.. warning:: **Model weight egress is an open governance problem**

   Federated training requires model weights to leave the TRE on every global round. This
   creates a tension with TRE governance:

   - **TRE output-checking** processes are designed for human review of statistical outputs
     (tables, charts). Model weights are opaque numerical tensors that cannot be manually
     inspected for disclosure risk.

   - **Model weights can encode patient information.** Research has demonstrated membership
     inference attacks, gradient inversion attacks, and model memorisation that can
     reconstruct training data from model parameters.

   - **No UK TRE currently permits automated egress of model weights** through standard
     output-checking processes.

   - **Iterative exchange** compounds the problem -- a typical FL training run involves
     tens to hundreds of global rounds, each requiring model weights to cross the TRE
     boundary.

Mitigations for training egress
--------------------------------

Several technical mitigations can reduce the disclosure risk of model weight egress. These
do not eliminate the governance challenge but may support a risk-based approval process:

**Differential privacy (DP-SGD)**

FL frameworks provide differential privacy filters that add calibrated noise to model weight
updates before they leave the client (e.g. NVIDIA FLARE's privacy filters, Flower's central
and local DP strategies with adaptive clipping). DP provides formal mathematical bounds on
privacy leakage (the epsilon parameter), but clinically useful DP budgets (epsilon ~ 10) do not prevent
all attacks, while strict guarantees (epsilon < 1) can significantly degrade model performance.

On the NVFLARE backend, FLIP supports a **site-enforced privacy policy**: the operator sets
``FL_SITE_PRIVACY_POLICY=percentile`` (deterministic percentile clipping) in the trust's kit file,
and the resulting filter is applied to every
outgoing update *regardless of what the submitted job configures* — a researcher's app cannot
disable it. See :doc:`../components/component-fl-nodes` ("Site-enforced privacy policy") for
the parameters and semantics.

**Secure aggregation**

Some FL frameworks support homomorphic encryption (e.g. NVIDIA FLARE's TenSEAL integration
using the CKKS scheme) which allows weight aggregation on encrypted values, so the FL server
never sees individual client weights. This prevents a curious aggregation server from
inspecting any single client's contribution.

**Gradient clipping**

FL frameworks typically provide gradient clipping filters that bound the contribution of any
single training example to the model update, limiting the information any one patient's
data can encode in the shared weights.

.. admonition:: Current recommendation

   For TRE deployments where federated training is required, work with the TRE operator
   and the Data Access Committee to establish a project-specific governance agreement
   covering model weight egress. This should specify:

   - The privacy-enhancing technologies to be applied (DP, secure aggregation).
   - The DP budget (epsilon) and clipping parameters.
   - Audit and logging requirements for all egress events.
   - Whether the TRE airlock process needs to be adapted for automated weight review
     (e.g. using SACRO-ML tools for post-hoc attack simulation).

   This is an active area of development in the UK TRE ecosystem. DARE UK's TREvolution
   programme is working toward standardised egress policies for federated learning
   workflows.

UK TRE Federation Landscape
============================

Deploying federated learning across TREs is an active area of development in the UK. The
`DARE UK <https://dareuk.org.uk/>`_
`TREvolution programme <https://dareuk.org.uk/trevolution/enable-federation/>`_
(UKRI-funded, launched 2025)
is developing standardised federation capabilities across UK TREs, including reference
architecture, semi-automated output checking, and federated analysis. TREvolution introduces
**Patterns** and **Weaves** -- configurable combinations of analysis type, technology
services, and egress rules. The first Weave is the **Five Safes TES**, which adopts the
`GA4GH Task Execution Service (TES) <https://ga4gh.github.io/task-execution-schemas/>`_
standard as the basis for interoperability, enabling TREs to receive and execute standardised
workflow tasks through a common API. Related projects include
`TRE-FX <https://trefx.uk/>`_ (which developed the
`Five Safes RO-Crate <https://trefx.uk/5s-crate/>`_ packaging format for governance metadata
around workflow outputs) and
`SACRO <https://github.com/AI-SDC/ACRO>`_ (which provides semi-automated output checking
tools, including an ML extension for attack simulation against trained models).

FLIP's TRE deployment model aligns with this direction. As TREvolution matures, its Patterns
framework could formalise different egress rules for different federated workflows (e.g.
metrics-only for evaluation vs. DP-protected weights for training), providing the governance
pathway that FLIP's TRE training use case currently lacks.

GPU Resource Management
------------------------

TRE environments may offer the ability to dynamically provision and release GPU resources
based on workload requirements. Unlike on-premise deployments where dedicated GPU hardware
(e.g. DGX systems) is always available, cloud-based TREs can scale GPU compute on demand.

FLIP's architecture supports this: some trust-side services (e.g. the ``data-access-api``
for OMOP queries) do not require GPU, while the FL client only needs GPU resources during
active training or evaluation jobs. TRE operators may wish to:

- Provision GPU instances only when FL jobs are scheduled, and release them between jobs.
- Periodically re-evaluate GPU resource allocation based on model size, training duration,
  and concurrent workload.
- Use spot/preemptible GPU instances for evaluation jobs (which can be restarted) and
  reserved instances for training jobs (which benefit from continuity).

The FLIP Docker Compose configuration separates GPU-dependent services (FL client) from
non-GPU services (Trust API, data access API, XNAT), making it straightforward to run
them on different compute tiers within the TRE.
