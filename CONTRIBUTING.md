## Introduction

Welcome to the Federated Learning Interoperability Platform (FLIP)! We're excited you're here and want to contribute. This documentation is intended for individuals and institutions interested in contributing to FLIP. FLIP is an open-source project and, as such, its success relies on its community of contributors willing to keep improving it. Your contribution will be a valued addition to the code base; we simply ask that you read this page and understand our contribution process, whether you are a seasoned open-source contributor or whether you are a first-time contributor.

### Communicate with us

We are happy to talk with you about your needs for FLIP and your ideas for contributing to the project. One way to do this is to create an issue discussing your thoughts. It might be that a very similar feature is under development or already exists, so an issue is a great starting point.

When creating issues, please use the appropriate issue template:

- [**Bug Report**](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues/new?template=BUG-REPORT-FORM.yml) -- for reporting bugs and unexpected behaviour
- [**Feature Request**](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues/new?template=FEATURE-ISSUE-FORM.yml) -- for proposing new features or enhancements
- [**Task**](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues/new?template=TASK-ISSUE-FORM.yml) -- for general tasks that would not require any coding.
- [**Documentation**](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues/new?template=DOCUMENTATION-ISSUE-FORM.yml) -- for reporting documentation issues or proposing improvements to documentation.

### Project overview

FLIP is developed by the [London AI Centre](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/) in collaboration with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London. It is an open-source platform for federated training and evaluation of medical imaging AI models across healthcare institutions, while ensuring data privacy and security.

The FLIP repository is a mono-repo: it consolidates the Central Hub API, Trust APIs, UI, Docker deployment, **and**
the federated learning code (base library, FL services, and tutorials) for both NVFLARE and Flower. Both backends
are provisioned in-tree (gitignored) under `fl-services/<backend>/provision/`. See the single canonical
[repository layout](README.md#repository-layout) in the root README and the README within each area for details.

## Setting up the development environment

### Prerequisites

- A Linux development host; a CUDA-capable GPU is required for GPU-backed tutorials and training
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with Compose and Swarm mode
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
  on GPU hosts
- GNU Make, `jq`, and `curl`
- [Python 3.12 or 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- The AWS CLI configured for SSO access to the development environment
- [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) if you want to run GitHub Actions locally
- **GHCR login** — `make up` pulls the repo-built service images from GitHub Container Registry by default, so authenticate once with a PAT that has `read:packages`:
  ```bash
  echo "$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u <your-github-username> --password-stdin
  ```
  Building everything locally instead (no GHCR access needed) is `make up BUILD=true` — see [Running the stack](#running-the-stack-pull-vs-build) below.

### Recommended IDE Setup

The file [`recommended_extensions.vsix`](recommended_extensions.vsix) contains a bundle of recommended VS Code
extensions for FLIP development. Install with:

```bash
code --install-extension recommended_extensions.vsix
```

Key extensions include:

- `ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack` — connect to Docker containers and remote servers via SSH for in-container development, avoiding the need to rebuild images on every change
- Python linting/formatting (ruff, mypy)
- Docker tooling

Other useful tools:

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) — API testing
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) — package manager for macOS/Linux

#### Open the multi-root workspace (not the folder)

FLIP is a monorepo of independent Python sub-projects, each with its own `.venv` and `pyproject.toml`. Open it via the
checked-in [`flip.code-workspace`](flip.code-workspace) — **File → Open Workspace from File…** — rather than opening the
repo root as a plain folder. The multi-root workspace lets Pylance use each folder's own interpreter and Ruff its own
config; for example, `nvflare` imports resolve only when `fl-services/nvflare/fl-api-base` is using its own `.venv`.
Opening the repo root as a single folder applies one interpreter (flip-api) to every file, so cross-project imports such
as `nvflare` show up as unresolved.

After opening, confirm the per-folder interpreter with **Python: Select Interpreter** (it prompts for the folder first,
then the `.venv`), and run **Developer: Reload Window** if an import is still flagged.

### Python environment management

FLIP uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) for all Python services. Each service has a `pyproject.toml` and a
`.python-version` file in its root directory.

To install dependencies for a service:

```bash
uv sync
```

To add a new dependency:

```bash
uv add <package-name>            # runtime dependency
uv add <package-name> --dev      # development-only dependency
uv add <package-name> --group <group>  # dependency in a named group
```

The `pyproject.toml` file is the source of truth for dependencies. The Python version in `.python-version` must match
the version used in the service's Dockerfile.

### Dependency cooldown (supply-chain protection)

Recent npm and PyPI supply-chain attacks follow a consistent pattern: a maintainer's credentials are compromised, a
malicious release is published, the community detects it, and the package is yanked — usually within a few hours. To
keep poisoned releases out of FLIP's CI, developer machines, and Trust-side containers, FLIP enforces a **72-hour
cooldown** on dependency installs:

> No FLIP build, CI or local, may install a Python or JavaScript package whose release timestamp on its upstream
> registry (PyPI / npm) is less than 72 hours old. This applies to direct **and** transitive dependencies.

The policy is enforced through native package-manager configuration:

- **uv (Python)** — every `pyproject.toml` sets `tool.uv.exclude-newer = "3 days"`, so `uv lock` and `uv add` never
  resolve a release younger than 72 hours (the `uv.lock` records this as a rolling `exclude-newer-span`). The
  **Dependency Cooldown Check** job in [`secret-scanning.yml`](.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml) runs
  `uv lock --check` on every project, failing CI if a lockfile drifts from its manifest or was generated under a
  wider `exclude-newer` window than the committed manifest allows.
- **npm (JavaScript)** — `flip-ui/.npmrc` sets `min-release-age=3`, so `npm install` refuses to resolve a release
  younger than 72 hours. This key was introduced in npm 11.10, so `flip-ui/Dockerfile` and the `test_flip_ui.yml`
  workflow use Node 24 LTS (which ships npm >= 11.10); Node 22 LTS bundles npm 10.x and silently ignores the key.
  CI installs use `npm ci`, which fails on any `package-lock.json` / `package.json` mismatch. npm only enforces
  `min-release-age` at lockfile-write time (`npm install <pkg>`), not when installing from a pinned
  `package-lock.json`, so the npm cooldown rests on `.npmrc` rather than a CI gate.

There is no automated dependency-update bot wired into the repo today. Dependency bumps are hand-rolled PRs; the
two layers above (uv `exclude-newer` and npm `min-release-age` at install time, `uv lock --check` in CI) catch a
too-fresh package regardless of how it arrived in the lockfile.

The cooldown applies automatically when you run `uv add <package>` or `npm install <package>` — a release younger
than 72 hours is simply not selected. Run `make lock` to refresh every `uv.lock` after a dependency change.

#### Emergency override

For a genuine same-day patch of an active CVE, the cooldown can be bypassed for the single package that needs it:

- **uv** — add an `exclude-newer-package` entry under `[tool.uv]` for that package (for example
  `exclude-newer-package = { "<package>" = "<recent-timestamp>" }`) and re-run `uv lock`. The entry is committed, so
  the exception is visible in the pull request and `uv lock --check` still passes.
- **npm** — run `npm install <package> --min-release-age=0`, which overrides the `.npmrc` setting for that one
  command.

Any override must be justified in the pull-request description. Use it only for security patches that genuinely
cannot wait 72 hours.

### Environment variables

Environment variables for local development are defined in [`.env.development.example`](.env.development.example). This file uses
dummy/safe credentials for local use and **must not be used in production**. It centrally configures all services.

To get started, copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.development.example .env.development
```

Then generate the internal service key (also generated automatically by `make up`):

```bash
make generate-internal-service-key
```

This writes `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` with `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HASH` into `.env.development` for
fl-server-to-hub authentication.

For the full local stack, replace every placeholder in these minimum groups before running `make up`:

| Group | Required development values |
| --- | --- |
| AWS session | `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION` |
| Central Hub auth | `AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`, `AWS_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` |
| Email | an SES-verified `SES_VERIFIED_EMAIL` |
| Local secrets | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, a base64-encoded 32-byte `AES_KEY_BASE64` |
| Runtime S3 | `FLIP_MODEL_FILES_UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME`, `FLIP_FL_RESULTS_BUCKET_NAME`, `FLIP_APP_BUNDLES_BUCKET_NAME`, `AICENTRE_BUCKET_NAME` |
| XNAT artifacts | `FLIP_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME`, containing the versioned WAR and plugin set described in [`trust/xnat/README.md`](trust/xnat/README.md#plugins) |

Development uses these configured AWS services directly; there is no LocalStack fallback. Authorised FLIP developers
can use the shared development values. Other deployers should create their own resources with the
[Central Hub deployment guide](docs/source/deploy-flip/deploy-central-hub.rst).

Trusts are registered on the **running hub** with `make register-trusts` (shipped dev roster) or
`make register-trust KIT=<CODE>` (one trust), which inserts each `trust` row (with its
`api_key_hash`), claims an FL kit slot, and fills that trust's kit file `trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`
carrying `TRUST_API_KEY` and `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY`. `make up` runs `register-trusts`
automatically once the hub is up.

Docker services receive these variables via the `env_file` directive in the
compose file — avoid hardcoding values in Dockerfiles or compose files directly.

**Authentication environment variables:**

- `TRUST_API_KEY_HEADER` — HTTP header name for trust-to-hub authentication.
- `TRUST_API_KEY` — single per-trust plaintext API key. Lives only in that trust's kit file
  (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`), written by `make register-trusts`; never on the hub.
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER` — HTTP header name for fl-server-to-hub authentication.
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` — internal service key used by the fl-server on the Central Hub.
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HASH` — hub-side SHA-256 hash of the internal service key.
- `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER` — HTTP header name for trust-internal service auth (default
  `X-Trust-Internal-Service-Key`). Sent by every caller (trust-api, imaging-api, fl-client) on every
  call to imaging-api or data-access-api.
- `TRUST_INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` — single per-trust plaintext key, in that trust's kit file
  (`trust/.env.<CODE>.<env>`), minted by `register_trust`. Read by every trust-internal container. The hub
  never sees it. Distinct from `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY*` (which protects fl-server → flip-api on the
  Central Hub). See the [public security model](docs/source/security.rst#trust-internal-service-authentication).

FL clients (trust side) intentionally do **not** receive Central Hub API credentials. Only the fl-server (on the Central
Hub) communicates with flip-api. FL clients relay metrics and exceptions to the fl-server, which forwards them.

**FL-specific environment variables:**

- `FL_PROVISIONED_DIR` — path to the NVFLARE or Flower provisioned workspace, derived per-backend by `deploy/fl_backend.mk` from `FL_BACKEND`. The Makefile automatically converts this to an absolute path (Docker requires absolute paths for volume mounts). This directory contains certificates, keys, `fed_client.json`, and other files generated during provisioning for each network. Both are now provisioned in-tree (gitignored): NVFLARE at `fl-services/nvflare/provision/workspace-dev`, Flower at `fl-services/flower/provision/creds`.
- `FL_API_PORT` — port for FL API services (default: `8000`).

### Setting up AWS access

Some services (e.g. `flip-api`) interact with AWS via `boto3`. You will need AWS credentials configured locally.

Configure AWS SSO:

```bash
aws configure sso
```

For headless/SSH environments, use the device authorization flow:

```bash
aws configure sso --use-device-code
```

Log in to AWS in a new terminal session:

```bash
aws sso login --profile <your-profile-name>
```

To avoid specifying the profile name on every command:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile-name>
```

### GitHub Secrets for CI

The CI/CD pipeline requires GitHub repository secrets to run tests and deployments. See
[.github/SECRETS.md](.github/SECRETS.md) for the complete list, how to generate them, and security best practices.

### Running the CI pipeline locally

To debug failing CI jobs without pushing, use `act` (requires Docker):

```bash
make ci
```

This runs all jobs defined in `.github/workflows/` locally.

### CI checks on forks

Contributors work from a [fork](#the-contribution-process), and a fork's CI runs with the fork's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`
and **without** the upstream repository secrets. Workflows that **publish or deploy** therefore cannot run on a fork —
they would only ever fail trying to reach `londonaicentre`-owned resources — so each is guarded with
`if: github.repository == 'londonaicentre/FLIP'` and shows up as **skipped** (neutral, not a red failure) on fork
pushes. These are:

- **Image publishing** — `Build and Push NVFLARE/Flower FL Docker Images`, and the `orthanc`, `xnat-*`, `flip-api`,
  and `trust-*` GHCR build-and-push workflows.
- **Releases** — `release.yml` and `release-pypi.yml` (git tags, GitHub releases, PyPI publishing).

Everything that **validates** your change still runs on your fork, and a red result there is a real failure to fix:
lint, type-checking, unit and integration tests, docs, Terraform validation, Helm tests, and secret scanning.
Coverage upload to Codecov is non-blocking (`fail_ci_if_error: false`), so a missing `CODECOV_TOKEN` on your fork
never fails an otherwise-green job.

### Running the stack (pull vs. build)

In development (`PROD` unset), `make up` **pulls** the repo-built service images
(`flip-api`, `trust-api`, `imaging-api`, `data-access-api`, `orthanc`) from GHCR
instead of building them — each carries `image:` + `pull_policy: always` in the dev
compose, and your local `src/` is bind-mounted on top, so editing a `.py` still
hot-reloads against the pulled image. Startup is fast and matches the published
`:stag` artifact's environment.

```bash
make up                # pull GHCR images (default; requires `docker login ghcr.io`)
make up BUILD=true     # rebuild the repo-built services from local source instead
```

Use `BUILD=true` when you've changed **dependencies** (`uv.lock`/`pyproject.toml`),
system packages, or a `Dockerfile` — those live in the image layer, so a plain
`make up` (which pulls) won't pick them up. `flip-ui` always builds locally (it has
no GHCR image). Stag/prod (`PROD=stag|true`) are unaffected: they run the prod
compose with baked images and no bind-mounts.

## The contribution process

*Fork the repository before making changes* [Learn how to fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo). All contributions to the `develop` branch must be made via pull requests. This allows us to review your changes and ensure they meet our quality standards before merging them into the main codebase.

*Pull request early*, *commit often*. Don't wait until your changes are perfect before creating a pull request.
Commit your changes in small, logical chunks with clear commit messages. This makes it easier for reviewers to understand your changes and provide feedback.

We encourage you to create pull requests early. It helps us track the contributions under development, whether they are ready to be merged or not. [Create a draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) until it is ready for formal review.

### Preparing pull requests

To ensure code quality, FLIP relies on linting tools ([ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff)), static type analysis ([mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)), as well as a set of unit and integration tests.

This section highlights all the necessary preparation steps required before sending a pull request. To collaborate efficiently, please read through this section and follow them. Make sure you configure your coding environment to follow the configurations in the `pyproject.toml` files so these are automatically enforced.

- [Checking the coding style](#checking-the-coding-style)
- [Unit testing](#unit-testing)
- [Signing your work](#signing-your-work)

#### Checking the coding style

FLIP uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff) for both linting and formatting. The ruff configuration is defined in the `pyproject.toml` file at the root of the repository and in each service directory.

The project-wide ruff rules are:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 120
target-version = "py312"

[tool.ruff.lint]
preview = true
select = ['I', 'F', 'E', 'W', 'PT', 'UP006', 'UP007', 'UP035', 'UP042', 'UP045']
```

We also use [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for static type checking.

Before submitting a pull request, ensure all linting passes by running the following commands from the relevant service directory:

```bash
# Run linting with auto-fix
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Run type checking
uv run mypy .
```

Most services have a `Makefile` with a `test` target that runs linting, type checking, and tests in sequence. For example, from a Python service directory:

```bash
make test
```

The `flip-ui` service uses `make unit_test` (Vitest) instead of `make test`.

Documentation follows the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for Python docstrings.

If your PR contains code inspired by other code bases, you MUST inform us in your PR so we can add proper references to the original code and evaluate whether it can be incorporated into our License framework.

#### Unit testing

*If it's not tested, it's broken*, so all new functionality should be accompanied by an appropriate set of tests. Existing tests throughout the services can serve as examples.

FLIP uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing and [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for measuring code coverage.

Tests are located within each service's directory (e.g. `flip-api/tests/`, `trust/trust-api/tests/`). Test file names follow the `test_[module_name].py` or `[module_name]_test.py` convention.

To run tests for a specific service, navigate to the service directory and run:

```bash
uv run pytest --tb=short --disable-warnings --cov=src/ --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
```

Or use the Makefile shorthand:

```bash
make test
```

This will run ruff, mypy, and pytest in sequence. The coverage report is generated in HTML format in the `htmlcov` directory.

To run unit tests across all services in the main repository from the root:

```bash
make unit_test
```

`make tests` is a narrower target that runs `flip-ui` unit and Cypress e2e tests followed by the full `flip-api`
test suite (ruff, mypy, and pytest).

For the FL base library in `flip-utils/`, unit tests can be run either directly with pytest or via the shipped
Makefile target:

```bash
cd flip-utils && uv run pytest tests/unit -s -vv
# or:
make -C flip-utils unit-test   # ruff --fix + pytest with coverage
```

See [`flip-utils/README.md`](flip-utils/README.md) for the FL package's tests, and
[`fl-services/nvflare/README.md`](fl-services/nvflare/README.md) for provisioning FL networks.

**Kubernetes chart testing**: The K8s Helm chart at `deploy/providers/kubernetes/` can be tested with:

```bash
# Lint + render + schema validation
make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes test

# Render all FL backend variants
make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes template-all-backends

# Validate rendered templates against K8s schema (requires kubeconform)
make -C deploy/providers/kubernetes validate
```

The chart has a `check_status.py` smoke test script and a `register_k8s_trust.py` registration script. See the [K8s README](deploy/providers/kubernetes/README.md) for details.

**Testing fixtures**: For testing APIs and integration tests, we use [pytest fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html). Shared fixtures are defined in `conftest.py` files. In some cases, [`factory_boy`](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/) is used to create test data following production data structures.

All new functionality should be accompanied by an appropriate set of tests. Existing tests throughout the services can serve as examples.

Add these sections to the service's `pyproject.toml` to configure pytest and coverage:

```toml
[tool.coverage.report]
exclude_lines = ["if __name__ == .__main__.:"]
omit = ["*.venv/*", "*/tests/*", "*/__init__.py"]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
python_files = ["test_*.py", "*_test.py"]
addopts = []
filterwarnings = ["ignore::DeprecationWarning", "ignore::FutureWarning"]
```

#### Where does my test go?

A test belongs in `tests/integration/` **if and only if it touches a real backing service**. Examples of "real backing service":

- A real Postgres (via the `session` fixture or Testcontainers)
- A real AWS service (S3, Cognito, SES)
- A running sibling API (trust-api, data-access-api, etc.) reachable over HTTP
- A real Orthanc / XNAT / OMOP fixture

If your test mocks **all** external dependencies (database session, HTTP client, AWS clients, sibling APIs), it's a unit test — put it in `tests/unit/`, mirroring the source layout (e.g. tests for `src/flip_api/user_services/set_user_roles.py` go in `tests/unit/user_services/test_set_user_roles.py`).

FastAPI `TestClient` on its own does **not** make a test "integration" — what matters is whether the dependencies it transitively hits are real or mocked. A `TestClient`-based test that overrides every dependency (via `app.dependency_overrides`) and patches the DB session is a unit test; one that runs against an un-overridden real Postgres is an integration test.

This rule applies across all services: `flip-api/tests/`, `trust/trust-api/tests/`, `trust/imaging-api/tests/`, `trust/data-access-api/tests/`, etc.

##### Tests for FL tutorials and app templates

Two trees sit outside any service and have their own home:

- **`fl-tutorials/tests/`** — the CPU-only suite over the tutorial apps' transform chains (`make -C fl-tutorials test`, and `.github/workflows/fl-tutorials-tests.yml` on every PR touching `fl-tutorials/**`). A test belongs here if it can assert on tutorial code with **no GPU, no dataset download, no FL image and no network** — transform composition, import-time correctness, and what the preprocessing chain actually feeds the model. Fixtures are synthesised in-process (see `fl-tutorials/tests/dicom_phantom.py`), never committed as data. Anything that needs real training to observe — convergence, metric values, multi-round behaviour — belongs instead with the GPU simulator harness (`make -C fl-tutorials run-tutorial`), which is not run in CI.
  The suite runs in **flip-utils' environment** (`flip-utils[full]`), which is what the FL images give these apps at runtime; it deliberately has no `pyproject.toml` of its own, and the per-tutorial `uv` environments are the wrong target (`arkplus_fine_tuning/pyproject.toml` does not declare `monai`, so that environment cannot import its own `data_utils.py`).
- **`fl-apps/`** — has no pytest suite; its invariant is the required-files manifest, checked by `fl-apps/check_required_files.sh` (pre-commit + `.github/workflows/fl-apps-check-required-files.yml`). Files that must stay byte-identical to another file — the Flower tutorial copies of the `fl-apps/flower/` templates, and the shared Ark+ evaluation sources — are pinned in `scripts/check_tutorial_sync.sh`.

##### flip-api: real-Postgres integration tests via Testcontainers

`flip-api/tests/integration/` boots a throwaway `postgres:16-alpine` container per pytest session via [testcontainers-python](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-python) (`tests/integration/conftest.py`). The fixture builds the schema by running the **Alembic migrations** (`alembic upgrade head`) — the same DDL dev/prod apply at boot — then seeds permissions / roles / role-permissions once, and truncates per-test tables between tests. Both the existing `session` fixture and FastAPI's `Depends(get_session)` are rewired at the throwaway DB, so a new test only needs to request `session` (raw SQL access) and/or `client` (`TestClient` against the same DB) — no per-test setup required.

CI runs these via `make integration_test` from `flip-api/`. Docker is preinstalled on `ubuntu-latest`, so no `services:` block is needed in the workflow. AWS-backed integration tests (Cognito, S3, SES) are out of scope for this fixture and are skip-marked at the file level until ticket B2 lands.

##### flip-api: database migrations (Alembic)

flip-api's PostgreSQL schema is owned by Alembic, not `SQLModel.metadata.create_all`. **Any schema-affecting change to `db/models/*.py` must ship a migration revision** in the same PR — run `make migration MESSAGE="..."` from `flip-api/` (flip-db must be up), review the autogenerated file (native PG enums + the `ARRAY(UUID)` column), and apply it with `make migrate`. The integration suite builds its schema from these migrations, and `tests/integration/test_migrations.py` is a **drift guard**: a model change without a matching revision makes the suite fail. See [`flip-api/README.md`](flip-api/README.md#database-migrations) for the full workflow and the enum gotchas.

#### Signing your work

FLIP enforces the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) on all pull requests. All commit messages should contain the `Signed-off-by` line with an email address.

Git has a `-s` (or `--signoff`) command-line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

```bash
git commit -s -m 'a new commit'
```

The commit message will be:

```bash
    a new commit

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <yourname@example.org>
```

### Submitting pull requests

All code changes to the `develop` branch must be done via [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests). All PRs should be associated with an issue.

1. Create a new ticket or take a known ticket from [the issue list](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/issues).
1. Check if there's already a branch dedicated to the task.
1. If the task has not been taken, [create a new branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
named `[ticket_id]-[task_name]`.
For example, branch name `19-ci-pipeline-setup` corresponds to issue #19.
The new branch should be based on the latest `develop` branch.

## Cutting a release

Releases are cut from `main`. The version is set in the root `pyproject.toml`, and merging to `main` triggers [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml), which reads that version, creates a `v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>` git tag, and publishes a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes. On the same merge, the per-service `.github/workflows/docker_build_*.yml` workflows rebuild every service and push the `:prod` image tag (alongside `:<sha>`) to GHCR. There is no separate release-publishing step beyond merging to `main`.

### Two release trains, two tag namespaces

A push to `main` cuts **two independent releases**, from two independently-versioned artefacts. They must never share a tag namespace: each workflow skips its own release when it finds its tag already present, so a version number claimed by one artefact would silently suppress the other's release — or, for flip-utils, its PyPI publish.

| Artefact | Version source | Workflow | Tag | Release title |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLIP platform | root [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) | [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) | `v<X.Y.Z>` | `Release v<X.Y.Z>` |
| flip-utils (PyPI `flip-utils`) | [`flip-utils/flip/__init__.py`](flip-utils/flip/__init__.py) | [`release-pypi.yml`](.github/workflows/release-pypi.yml) | `flip-utils-v<X.Y.Z>` | `flip-utils v<X.Y.Z>` |

The `flip-utils-` prefix is what keeps them apart: every `git tag --list 'v*.*.*'` lookup in the release and preview workflows matches platform tags only, so each train's changelog spans its own history. **Do not drop the prefix or widen those globs** — the two version sequences advance independently and will overlap.

> **Historical note:** flip-utils 0.4.1 was released just before this split and originally tagged `v0.4.1`, in the platform namespace. It was retro-tagged as `flip-utils-v0.4.1` (same commit, `c55f79e8`) and the old tag deleted, so the two namespaces are clean from `v0.4.0` / `flip-utils-v0.4.1` onwards. The published PyPI artefact was never affected.

See [flip-utils and the PyPI release path](#flip-utils-and-the-pypi-release-path) below and [`flip-utils/CONTRIBUTING.md`](flip-utils/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the flip-utils train in detail.

### Versioning

FLIP follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The version in the **root** [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) is the FLIP release version — it is what `release.yml` reads to create the git tag.

Separately, [`flip-utils/flip/__init__.py`](flip-utils/flip/__init__.py) carries `__version__`, the version of the published `flip-utils` package. It is what `release-pypi.yml` reads, and it is **not** required to track the root version.

Each service has its own version string:

- [`flip-api/pyproject.toml`](flip-api/pyproject.toml)
- [`flip-ui/package.json`](flip-ui/package.json)
- [`trust/trust-api/pyproject.toml`](trust/trust-api/pyproject.toml)
- [`trust/imaging-api/pyproject.toml`](trust/imaging-api/pyproject.toml)
- [`trust/data-access-api/pyproject.toml`](trust/data-access-api/pyproject.toml)

These are **independent**. Bump a service's version only when *that service* has user-visible changes, applying SemVer to the service alone. Services are not aligned with the root version on every release — a release where only `flip-ui` changed bumps the root and `flip-ui/package.json`, and nothing else. Per-service versions are informational today (deployments select images by branch via `:prod` / `:stag` tags, not by version string), but keeping them honest makes them useful for audit and changelog scope.

### Pre-release checklist

Before opening the release PR from `develop` to `main`:

- `develop` is green in [CI](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/actions).
- All PRs intended for this release are merged into `develop` and carry an appropriate label. The release-notes categories come from [`.github/release.yml`](.github/release.yml): `enhancement` / `feature`, `bug` / `fix`, `documentation` / `docs`, `ci` / `build`, `chore` / `dependencies`. PRs labelled `ignore-for-release` are excluded.
- Bump the `version` in the root `pyproject.toml` to the new release version. Additionally bump the `version` in any service file (`flip-api/pyproject.toml`, `flip-ui/package.json`, `trust/*/pyproject.toml`) whose code changed in this release, per the independent-SemVer rule above. Leave unchanged services alone.
- If `flip-utils/**` changed in this release, bump `__version__` in [`flip-utils/flip/__init__.py`](flip-utils/flip/__init__.py) — [`check-version-bump.yml`](.github/workflows/check-version-bump.yml) fails the `develop` → `main` PR unless it is valid semver and strictly higher than the latest `v*.*.*` tag. It need not match — or differ from — the root version; the two trains tag in separate namespaces (see [flip-utils and the PyPI release path](#flip-utils-and-the-pypi-release-path)).
- Curate the release-notes header in [`.github/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md) — Highlights, Breaking Changes, New Features, Bug Fixes. Editing the file is the only way to change those sections; the preview comment on the PR is regenerated from it on every push.
- Run `make unit_test` and `make integration_test` locally.

### Cutting the release

1. From a branch off `develop`, commit the version bumps above and open a PR targeting `develop` with title `Release v<X.Y.Z>`.
1. Once that merges and CI is green, open a PR from `develop` to `main`. [`validate_branch_origin.yml`](.github/workflows/validate_branch_origin.yml) rejects any PR to `main` that does not come from `develop`.
1. On that PR, check the automated gates before merging:
   - [`pr-release-notes-preview.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-release-notes-preview.yml) posts a **release-notes preview** comment — the rendered template header plus the generated changelog — and updates it in place on every push. Read it as the last check that the notes are right.
   - [`check-version-bump.yml`](.github/workflows/check-version-bump.yml) and [`check-package-metadata.yml`](.github/workflows/check-package-metadata.yml) run when `flip-utils/**` changed.
1. On merge to `main`:
   - [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) reads the root `pyproject.toml`, creates the `v<X.Y.Z>` git tag, and publishes the GitHub Release named `Release v<X.Y.Z>` with auto-generated notes.
   - [`release-pypi.yml`](.github/workflows/release-pypi.yml) reads `flip-utils/flip/__init__.py` and, if that version is not yet tagged, lints + tests + builds the package, publishes it to PyPI via OIDC trusted publishing, tags it, and publishes a GitHub Release named `flip v<X.Y.Z>` with the template header, the generated changelog, and the build artifacts attached.
   - Every `docker_build_*.yml` workflow under [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) rebuilds its service and pushes the `:prod` and `:<sha>` tags to GHCR.
1. Verify on the [Releases page](https://github.com/londonaicentre/FLIP/releases) that the new release exists and the notes look right. Verify on [GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/londonaicentre/packages) that the `:prod` tags on `flip-api`, `trust-api`, `imaging-api`, and `data-access-api` were updated by the latest build. If the package was released, verify it on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flip-utils/).

### Release notes

There is no `CHANGELOG.md` — the GitHub Releases page is the changelog. Release notes come from two pieces:

- **The generated changelog** — GitHub's release-notes API lists every PR merged since the previous `v*.*.*` tag, plus a contributors section, categorised by PR label according to [`.github/release.yml`](.github/release.yml): `enhancement` / `feature`, `bug` / `fix`, `documentation` / `docs`, `ci` / `build`, `chore` / `dependencies`, then Other Changes. PRs labelled `ignore-for-release` are excluded. Curating this means labelling each PR correctly **before** it merges into `develop` — it cannot be fixed at release time.
- **The hand-written header** — [`.github/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md), with `{{VERSION}}`, `{{TAG}}`, and `{{PREV_TAG}}` substituted. Edit this file on the release branch to fill in Highlights and the Breaking Changes / New Features / Bug Fixes summaries.

Both are rendered into the preview comment on the `develop` → `main` PR, and both go into the release published by `release-pypi.yml`. The release published by `release.yml` carries the generated changelog only, without the template header.

### flip-utils and the PyPI release path

`flip-utils` is the only component published as a package ([`flip-utils` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flip-utils/)), so it has a release path of its own driven by `__version__` in [`flip-utils/flip/__init__.py`](flip-utils/flip/__init__.py) rather than the root `pyproject.toml`.

The two paths use **separate tag namespaces** — `v<X.Y.Z>` for the platform, `flip-utils-v<X.Y.Z>` for the package (see [Two release trains, two tag namespaces](#two-release-trains-two-tag-namespaces) above) — and each skips when its own tag already exists. Bump only the root version and you cut a platform release; bump only `__version__` and you cut a package release. Because the namespaces no longer collide, bumping both in the same release PR is safe: the two workflows tag independently and neither can suppress the other, even when the version numbers happen to match.

Full detail — the per-PR gates, the trusted-publishing setup, and the `release.sh` manual fallback — is in [`flip-utils/CONTRIBUTING.md`](flip-utils/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Deploying the release

Once the `:prod` images are in GHCR, deploy with:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
make full-deploy PROD=true
```

See [`deploy/providers/AWS/README.md`](deploy/providers/AWS/README.md) for full deployment instructions. For staging, no release tag is required: merging to `develop` publishes `:stag` images automatically, and `make full-deploy PROD=stag` rolls them out.

### Hotfixes

For an urgent fix on `main` without pulling in unrelated `develop` work:

1. Branch from `main`, apply the fix, bump the patch version in the root `pyproject.toml` (and any affected service).
1. Open a PR targeting `main`. On merge, the same automation kicks in — `release.yml` tags `v<X.Y.Z+1>` and `docker_build_*.yml` rebuilds `:prod`.
1. Forward-port the fix to `develop` so the next regular release includes it.

### Testing a release candidate before merge to main

Branch builds **do not** auto-publish to GHCR. To deploy a release-candidate branch for testing, manually trigger the relevant build workflows first:

```bash
gh workflow run docker_build_flip_api.yml --ref <branch-name>
gh workflow run docker_build_trust_trust_api.yml --ref <branch-name>
# ...one per service whose image you want to test
```

Wait for green completion, then point your `.env` file's `DOCKER_TAG` at the sanitized branch name (the per-service workflows publish a `:<branch>` tag on every push).

## Adding a new service

To extend the platform with a new service, add a definition to the appropriate Docker Compose file:

```yml
# deploy/compose.development.yml
services:
  new-service:
    build:
      context: ../path/to/service
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ../path/to/service:/app
    depends_on:
      - flip-db
    env_file:
      - ../.env.development
```

Create a directory following the standard service layout:

```
new-service/
├── src/
│   └── new_service/
├── tests/
├── Dockerfile
├── Makefile
├── pyproject.toml
└── .python-version
```

Optionally add Makefile shortcuts at the repository root:

```makefile
new-service:
    docker compose -f deploy/compose.development.yml up -d new-service
```

## Creating test data for manual testing

To create projects in various pipeline stages (`unstaged`, `staged`, `approved`) for manual testing:

```bash
make -C flip-api create_testing_projects
```

To clean up the test data:

```bash
make -C flip-api delete_testing_projects
```

These are also available as VS Code tasks via **Terminal > Run Task** — look for `Create testing projects` and
`Delete testing projects`.

## Documentation GIFs

The admin user-action GIFs under `docs/source/assets/admin/` (referenced from
`docs/source/sys-admin/admin-project-and-user-management.rst`) are
auto-regenerated on every push to `main` by
`.github/workflows/regenerate_docs_gifs.yml`. The workflow records the demo
Cypress specs under `flip-ui/test/cypress/docs/admin/` against a fully mocked
backend, converts the resulting videos to GIFs with `ffmpeg`, and opens a PR
against `develop` for human review.

To regenerate locally:

```bash
cd flip-ui
npm run docs:record   # records videos under test/cypress/videos/docs/admin/
npm run docs:gifs     # ffmpeg → docs/source/assets/admin/*.gif (requires ffmpeg on PATH)
```

The demo specs reuse the functional suite's fixtures and `globalIntercepts`,
and layer a CSS cursor overlay (`flip-ui/test/cypress/docs/support/demoCursor.ts`)
on top so the recorded GIFs read as visible user actions. When adding a new
admin-area UI flow that should be documented, add one demo spec under
`flip-ui/test/cypress/docs/admin/<gif-basename>.spec.ts` — the filename maps
1:1 to the output GIF name.
