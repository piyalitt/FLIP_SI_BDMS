"""Inference operator for the FLIP chest radiograph classification model.

A classification MAP cannot use ``MonaiBundleInferenceOperator``: that operator maps an image to
an image, whereas a classifier produces labels. This operator therefore runs the scripted network
itself and emits a text result, which the DICOM Structured Report writer turns into a DICOM object.

The preprocessing below mirrors the training application's ``transforms.py::get_xray_transforms``
(validation branch): resize to 224x224, then scale intensity to [0, 1] on a single channel. Keeping
these in step with training is the app author's responsibility; a mismatch here degrades the result
silently.

There is deliberately **no orientation transform here**, on either side. The training chain loads
with ``LoadImaged(reader="PydicomReader", swap_ij=False)``, which returns the pixel array exactly as
``PixelData`` stores it — ``(row, column)`` — rather than MONAI's default transpose; this operator
receives its array from ``DICOMSeriesToVolumeOperator``, which preserves the same order. Both paths
agree on the image as stored, with nothing to undo (``fl-tutorials/tests/`` pins the training side).

Do not "restore" an orientation transform here by transcribing one from a training chain — a chain's
orientation step, when one exists, serves its loader, not the model. Verified by pushing the same CR
study through both paths: with no transform on either side, the two agree bit-for-bit
(``max|diff| == 0``) on both a square and a non-square radiograph, and disagree under every rotation
or flip.
